CARNEGIE MUSEUM OF ART
In June 2021, Carnegie Museum of Art embarked on a year-long strategic visioning process that brought together knowledge and experiences from individuals across the museum, the Pittsburgh region, and national and international art world to reflect on the museum's legacy, opportunities, challenges, and ambitions. The below strategic framework is the result of this visioning process. It guides our decision-making and it charts a dynamic and energizing future, transforming the museum's relationship to the audiences it serves and the art histories it narrates.
Our Mission Carnegie Museum of Art creates experiences that connect people to art, ideas, and one another. At Carnegie Museum of Art, we believe creativity is a defining human characteristic to which everyone should have access. Carnegie Museum of Art collects, preserves, and presents artworks from around the world to inspire, sustain, and provoke discussion, and to engage and reflect multiple audiences.
Our Values As one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Museum of Art embraces the Core Values of the larger institute:
Our Statement of Purpose Driven by curiosity, Carnegie Museum of Art makes space for expansive inquiry into the art and ideas that shape our time. Underpinning our organizational mission and values, our purpose articulates the museum's reason for being, or the central "why" we do what we do. This purpose is our guiding principle for our staff, leadership, advisory board, volunteers, and community partners as we forge ahead.
Our Value Proposition A Confluence of Creative Possibilities As the nation's first museum dedicated to collecting the art of its time, Carnegie Museum of Art is a meeting place for Pittsburgh and the world. Through the Carnegie International, our collection, artist-centered exhibitions, co-created educational resources, and dynamic public programs, we surface questions with both local and global relevance, building on history's lessons to contemplate, envision, and help manifest brave and imaginative futures. We strive to be an inquisitive and responsive institution, bringing together perspectives from the Pittsburgh region, the broader nation, and the globe to connect our lives to the larger human experience.
Guiding Ambitions These three guiding ambitions articulate the long-term, transformational impact we seek to have in the world. Each ambition is accompanied by a core question that we endeavor to answer through our work. Together, these ambitions serve as our compass for aligning the collective efforts of our many stakeholders, ensuring that every initiative and project we undertake contributes to our vision for the future.
Expand the Imaginative Capacity of Museum Work How might we exemplify a culture of creative exchange that sparks new possibilities for what a 21st-century museum can be? We aim to re-examine inherited narratives, histories, and ways of seeing in order to bring our museum, and the field as a whole, into more robust dialogue with our audiences and communities. By continually interrogating the purpose and field-wide implications of our practices, we seek to evolve and elevate our collection, commissions, programming, and operations in responsive and dynamic ways that model new directions for the field.
Catalyze Creative Agency How might we foster inclusive, affirming, and empowering experiences for all who engage with the museum? When we choose to welcome art into our lives, we unlock the vital power of creativity to transform ourselves and society. We aim to be an ever-evolving and responsive museum where a multiplicity of perspectives makes our museum experience richer, and where our staff and audiences alike are welcomed, seen, and empowered.
Enrich Our Region's Artistic Life How might we extend our impact and the work of local communities and partners through mutually beneficial and sustained relationships? We strive to be an active partner in gathering, connecting, and supporting the diverse individuals and organizations that put our region's cultural ecosystem on a national and international map. We commit ourselves to sharing our institutional resources, platform, and knowledge to foster stronger, more equitable, and reciprocal networks that uplift the creative vibrancy of our city and radiate their impact more widely than would be possible alone.
Strategic Focus Areas and Priorities To achieve our guiding ambitions and realize our vision for long-term impact, we commit to the following strategic focus areas which will guide our efforts through 2027. Internal Culture: Empowering a diverse and collaborative internal community As a community of colleagues and peers, we value the perspectives and wisdom that exists at all levels of our organization, and strive to champion individual agency, growth, collaboration, and openness in all that we do. We endeavor to be an employer of choice and a supportive training ground for those who are eager to make a robust impact in the world through art. Our Priorities Experience: Reimagining the museum experience to center welcome, access, and dialogue with audiences Building on our commitment to sharing art as an essential form of knowledge with the public, we believe a work of art isn't truly complete without the experience of the viewer. We are committed to listening to and learning from our audiences to ensure access to our collection, programs, and spaces on their own terms. Our Priorities Community: Leveraging the museum's resources to support and advocate for the communities of Pittsburgh As a neighborhood museum and resource, we aim to serve Pittsburgh artists and communities alike with intentionality and responsiveness. We strive to be a porous museum: sharing and activating our platform, assets, and expertise through vibrant and dynamic community partnerships both onsite and off. Our Priorities Field: Expanding the museum's reputation and influence on the world stage For over 125 years, Carnegie Museum of Art has been committed to showcasing the art and artists of the current moment while also building a vital archive of art from the past. From the ambitious execution of the Carnegie International to the daily work of our entire organization, we seek to build on our legacy of thought leadership through rigorous research, adventurous and artist-centered programming and partnerships, and forward-thinking contributions to museum discourse and practice. We are dedicated to fulfilling our role as a deeply local cultural institution that convenes and contributes to the global creative conversation. Our Priorities
When the Carnegie Institute opened in 1895, this hybrid institution—comprised of museums, a library, and a music hall—occupied the grand, historical spaces that would eventually become known as the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and the storied Carnegie Music Hall. The architectural firm behind these historic structures was Longfellow, Alden & Harlow, who had close ties to the influential Henry Hobson Richardson, creator of the Allegheny County Courthouse in downtown Pittsburgh. A decade later, the Carnegie Institute underwent a massive expansion, adding galleries, social spaces, and works of art. This addition included the Grand Staircase, adorned with John White Alexander's mural, The Crowning of Labor, the Hall of Sculpture, modeled after the Greek Parthenon, and the Hall of Architecture, which presents plaster casts of historic European masterpieces.
In 1974, renowned architect Edward Larrabee Barnes added to the grandeur of Carnegie Institute with the Sarah Mellon Scaife Galleries, which expanded the spaces dedicated to Carnegie Museum of Art. Barnes elevated the new galleries to an upper floor and clad them in Norwegian Larvikite stone, with ample natural light streaming in through roof lights. Working in collaboration with the legendary landscape architect Dan Kiley, the exterior spaces of the museum include the Sculpture Court and Fountain Plaza, complete with large-scale outdoor sculptures, such as Richard Serra's Carnegie. During your next visit to the museum, we encourage you to take in the architectural wonders of our building and its surrounding works of art.
Built after the Greek Parthenon, the Hall of Sculpture is a must-visit for all sculpture and architecture enthusiasts. Opened in 1907, the Hall of Architecture is one of only three architectural cast courts in the world. A soaring three-story historic staircase located at the heart of the museum was added to the original Carnegie Institute building in 1907. Relax among the sculptures from our collection in an open-air setting. At the museum's entrance on Forbes Avenue, you can find some of our most impressive sculptures. Did you know that the museum's teeniest, tiniest rooms are tucked between two of the biggest?
Our team includes experts across a broad range of disciplines that together contribute to the success of the museum. From curatorial, to design and publishing, to marketing and engagement, plus a score of other functions, the collective team is responsible for advancing the museum's mission and purpose, while demonstrating the values of the institute. Carnegie Museum of Art is one of four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. To check out who works here, feel free to scroll below. And to learn more about joining us, visit our careers page.

CARNEGIE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
Carnegie Museum of Natural History is one of the great cultural institutions funded and built by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who made his fortune in Pittsburgh’s steel industry. Carnegie’s vision was that the museum would exhibit the wonders of nature to everyone from mill workers to affluent society members.
When it opened in 1895, the museum’s early collections included artifacts from ancient Egypt, beautiful minerals, exotic wildlife taxidermy, and, of course, dinosaurs.
Carnegie, an ardent evolutionist, had a particular interest in dinosaurs that fueled paleontology expeditions. In the late 1890s, expeditions to the western United States led to the discovery of Diplodocus carnegii and many other dinosaurs. Early expeditions yielded more than 400 crates of fossils that kick-started the dinosaur collection that filled the now-famous Dinosaurs in Their Time hall.
As the museum grew and expanded, Carnegie botanists, entomologists, zoologists, anthropologists, and other scientists studying the natural world traveled abroad on expeditions from the Arctic to the Amazon in search of new discoveries and scientific insights. The artifacts, flora, and fauna they collected grew the Carnegie research and display collection from thousands to millions of objects.
Continuing this spirit of exploration, but now a little closer to home, the museum established Powdermill Nature Reserve in 1956. The new field station and laboratory in Rector, Pennsylvania helped museum researchers do long-term studies of natural populations in western Pennsylvania.
More than 100 years after Carnegie’s initial gift, Carnegie Museum of Natural History remains a place of scientific inquiry and a world class public institution. As species die out and habitats decline, a new emphasis has been placed on conservation. By displaying nature’s wonders, museum leaders hope to spark conversation about the inherent worth of nature and to inspire a new generation of scientists to conserve both the planet and Carnegie’s vision.

The Warhol is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, and a collaborative project between Carnegie Institute, Dia Art Foundation, and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. Plans to house The Warhol in Pittsburgh were announced in 1989, and the museum opened its doors during a 24-hour celebration on May 13, 1994. Originally built in 1911 as a distribution center for products sold to mills and mines, The Warhol was redesigned by architect Richard Gluckman and features seven floors of gallery and exhibition space as well as an underground level that houses The Factory education studio and the conservation lab.
Carnegie Museums
Established in 1895 by Andrew Carnegie, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh is a collection of four distinct museums: Carnegie Museum of Art, opens new tab, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, opens new tab, Carnegie Science Center, opens new tab, and The Andy Warhol Museum. The museums reach more than 1.4 million people a year through exhibitions, educational programs, outreach activities, and special events.
