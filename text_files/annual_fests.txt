CELEBRATION OF LIGHTS
The Celebration of Lights was a winter holiday season Christmas lights show in Pittsburgh. Held at Hartwood Acres Park from 1991 to 2011, it generated funds for WTAE-TV's "Project Bundle-Up" charity and the Salvation Army.
The show consisted of a 3.5 mile drive through Hartwood Acres Park. Over the 20 year life of the show, it generated $3.7 million for charity. In 1991, the 28 displays had 250,000 lights; by 2011 it had grown to 2,000,000 lights. The Oglebay Winter Festival of Lights is a similar event at Oglebay Park in Wheeling, West Virginia.
In 2010, a 3-year sponsor, Rite Aid withdrew from sponsorship.
In September 2012, Chief Executive of Allegheny County Rich Fitzgerald announced that he was cancelling the Celebration of Lights due to inability to find corporate sponsorship.[2] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette defended the decision in light of public outcry.[7] Following the announcement, private citizens began to search for new sponsors

FRESH FEST BEER FEST
Fresh Fest Beer Fest is a beer festival held annually in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, since 2018. Geared towards increasing diversity in the craft beer industry, Fresh Fest is the nation's first festival for Black-owned breweries. 
Origins
Fresh Fest was conceived by podcast hosts Day Bracey and Ed Bailey of the Drinking Partners Podcast, and entrepreneur Mike Potter of Black Brew Culture. Citing a lack of diversity in craft beer brewers and consumers, the creators sought both to bring together Black-owned breweries and provide and inclusive space to connect beer drinkers. In addition to Black-owned breweries nationwide, Fresh Fest also showcases Pittsburgh-area breweries through partnerships with local Black businesses, entrepreneurs, politicians, and other personalities.
Location
The 2018 and 2019 Fresh Fests were held at Nova Place on Pittsburgh's North Shore. Since 2021, Fresh Fest's a block party in Pittsburgh's Allentown neighbourhood. The COVID-19 pandemic caused 2020's cancellation of most events, and some had gone virtual.

INTERNATIONAL POETRY FORUM (IPF)
The International Poetry Forum (IPF) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1966 by Samuel John Hazo in Pittsburgh, PA.[1] Since its inception, the IPF has hosted poetry readings and educational programs by over 800 poets and performers from more than 50 countries at the Carnegie Lecture Hall, Carnegie Music Hall, Heinz Hall, and other venues in Pittsburgh.[2] The organization has also presented a series of performances at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.[3][4] Alumni of the IPF include nine Nobel Prize laureates, 14 Academy Award winners, 28 U.S. Poet Laureates, 39 National Book Award winners, and 47 Pulitzer Prize winners. Often cited as one of the most significant poetry programs in the country, the IPF has received the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal from the Smithsonian for its contributions to the arts.
History
With initial funding from the Mellon Trust, the International Poetry Forum's inaugural reading featured Archibald MacLeish at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Lecture Hall on October 19, 1966. Other poets to perform at the IPF have included W.H. Auden, Jorge Luis Borges, Seamus Heaney, Mary Oliver, Octavio Paz, Elizabeth Bishop, Czesław Miłosz, Robert Penn Warren, Derek Walcott, Gwendolyn Brooks, Adonis, Donald Hall, John Berryman, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, James Merrill, Mary Karr, Dana Gioia, Richard Wilbur, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Robert Lowell, May Swenson, Adrienne Rich, Jan Beatty, W.S. Merwin, Joseph Brodsky, John Ashbery, Denise Levertov, Tomas Tranströmer, Billy Collins, Lucille Clifton, Paul Muldoon, Edward Kamau Brathwaite, Joyce Carol Oates, and Terrance Hayes.
Participating actors have included Anthony Hopkins, Gregory Peck, Brooke Shields, Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, Ellen Burstyn, José Ferrer, Danny Glover, and James Earl Jones. The IPF has also featured novelists such as Kurt Vonnegut, Chinua Achebe, and Saul Bellow, playwrights such as Edward Albee and Tennessee Williams, musicians such as Judy Collins, Noel Harrison, and The Clancy Brothers, and public figures such as Queen Noor of Jordan and Princess Grace of Monaco.[1][7][10]
As a 501(c)(3) organization, the IPF has subsisted on foundation grants and individual support. Citing Hazo's retirement and a scarcity of grant funding during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the IPF paused its poetry readings in 2009.[12] During its initial run, the IPF hosted its own press and funded initiatives like the Poets-in-Person outreach program, which sent authors to speak at schools across Western Pennsylvania.[13]
In 2023, after a 14-year hiatus, Hazo announced the revival of the International Poetry Forum, naming local academic Jake Grefenstette as his successor.[14] Grefenstette has cited plans to relaunch poetry readings and educational outreach initiatives during the 2024-2025 academic year.[15]
Legacy
In 1967, the University of Pittsburgh Press launched the Pitt Poetry Series in collaboration with the International Poetry Forum as a platform for publishing winning manuscripts of the IPF's United States Award, which was awarded from 1967-1977.
Samuel Hazo, IPF founder and director of 43 years, was named Pennsylvania’s first Poet Laureate in 1993, a position he served for a decade.[17][18] For his work directing the IPF, Hazo received the Griffin Award and an honorary doctorate from the University of Notre Dame,[19] the Hazlett Award for Excellence in Literature from the Pennsylvania Governor, and the Forbes Medal for Outstanding Cultural Contributions to Western Pennsylvania.[20][21][22]
In 2001, Hazo established the IPF archives at Carlow University. Audio recordings for the 1966-2009 sessions have since been digitized and made available through the International Poetry Forum Collection at Carlow’s Grace Library.
In 2022, the Carlow University Art Gallery opened an exhibition entitled “To Hear it With Our Eyes: Activist Voices in the International Poetry Forum (1966-1974),” which explored the writing and activism of IPF participants like Derek Walcott, Adonis, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Kurt Vonnegut.
In January 2023, in advance of the announcement of the IPF relaunch, Carlow University presented “The Power of Poetry: Celebrating the Legacy of the International Poetry Forum,” a public event featuring poetry readings by Samuel Hazo, Naomi Shihab Nye, Richard Blanco, and Tracy K. Smith.


LIGHT UP NIGHT
Light Up Night is a family festival in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania coinciding with the unofficial start of the Winter holiday shopping season. Many retailers in Downtown Pittsburgh remain open late, and street vendors and other concessionaires sell food and give away hot beverages, treats and promotional items. The city is decorated with Christmas lights, trees, among other holiday decorations. On Light Up Night, the skyscrapers and buildings in and around downtown keep their lights on throughout the night, lending to the name. Over 200,000 people attend the festivities.
Light Up Night is also a time for free music, including many choirs, street performers, and even rock concerts, downtown and in Station Square.[2] In addition, the city offers free carriage rides downtown.
The event was held in November on the Friday before Thanksgiving until 2019, then on the Saturday before Thanksgiving from 2021.
With the increasing popularity of the event, The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership has threatened to sue other communities and organizations that fail to pay a licensing fee for trademark infringement.[3]
Traditions
The University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning illuminated for Light Up Night.
The lighting of the Christmas tree in the ice skating rink in PPG Place is an annual tradition. When the lights are turned on, the ice skating rink officially opens to the public for the season. At 9,600 square feet (890 m2), the surface is over 2,000 square feet (190 m2) larger than the famous rink in New York's Rockefeller Center.[4][5] Each year, the Wintergarden inside PPG Place features a model train, gingerbread houses, and a collection of life-sized Santa Claus figures in traditional dress representing countries around the world.[6]
The lighting of the electric tree on the corner of the old Horne's department store is an old tradition which continues to this day. A pyrotechnics show accompanies the lighting. Trees throughout the city are also lit with ceremony, including the Unity Tree at Penn Avenue Plaza.
Pittsburgh Crèche
The Pittsburgh Crèche is a large-scale nativity scene located on the outside courtyard of the U.S. Steel Tower. Since 1999, the crèche appears annually during the winter season from Light Up Night to Epiphany in January. It is the only authorized replica of the nativity scene in Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome.
Many performers and mascots frequent the streets downtown, posing for pictures with children, or giving away treats. In recent years, the Kings Family Restaurants Frownie Brownie mascot has made his rounds with samples.
Other events
Macy's display window: Macy's department store, in the old Kaufmann's building, continued the tradition of its former tenant by revealing its Christmas display in the windows along Smithfield Street before its 2015 closure. The windows in the display's latter years took their theme from the story of Virginia O'Hanlon's editorial to the New York Sun, asking if there is a Santa Claus.
Market Square: Market Square is filled with booths offering toys, giveaways, and food. Duquesne Light has a popular booth in Market Square which hands out free glow sticks to children and adults. In the plaza behind Gateway Center, vendors offer more freebies, and KDKA provides free hot chocolate and cookies.
Music: Several live performances and concerts occur on Light Up Night. In 2014, Cobra Starship performed onstage near the Roberto Clemente Bridge.[12]
Fireworks: The night usually ends with fireworks. Originally lighted over Point State Park, in more recent years the fireworks have been launched from the Andy Warhol Bridge (7th Street Bridge) and barges on the Allegheny River

MELLON JAZZ FESTIVAL
The Mellon Jazz Festival was a festival in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that was sponsored by Mellon Bank. Acts who performed at the festival included Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Krall, Sonny Rollins, and John Zorn. The event began under the name Pittsburgh Jazz Festival in 1964 and closed in 2003.

NEW AMERICAN MUSIC UNION
New American Music Union was a two-day summer music festival scheduled on August 8 and 9, 2008, at the SouthSide Works in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lineups on two different stages were curated by Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It featured established music acts along with college bands vying for a recording contract. The show was presented by American Eagle Outfitters and co-produced by Live Nation. It was designed to be a Pittsburgh version of Milwaukee's Summerfest and Seattle's Bumbershoot.
Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reviewed the Gnarls Barkley performance favorably, while criticizing Bob Dylan's set list choices. Mervis' review resulted in several contrary letters to the editor.
The festival, which had been planned as an annual event, did not return for a second year because American Eagle Outfitters had moved away from using music as a marketing tool.
College band competition
The college bands on the second stage were judged by a panel including industry and media professionals as well as other musicians. The winner received a full-day recording session in a recording studio in Los Angeles and promotion by American Eagle. The Black Fortys from Southern Illinois University were announced the winners of the best college band by Anthony Kiedis on Saturday August 9

PICKLESBURGH
Picklesburgh is an annual pickle-themed festival in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It has taken place in Downtown Pittsburgh every summer since 2015 (excluding 2020),originally on the Three Sisters bridges and along the Allegheny Riverfront, before relocating to the Boulevard of the Allies and PPG Place for its 2023 installment.
The festival showcases "all things pickled," including pickle-flavored beer and cocktails, pickle ice cream, and other pickled foods such as dilly beans and kimchi. It also features live music, children's activities, and an annual pickle juice drinking competition, the winner of which is crowned the "Mayor of Picklesburgh". The festival's centerpiece is a 35-foot-long (11 m) Heinz pickle balloon.
Picklesburgh was voted the "best specialty food festival in America" in USA Today readers' polls in 2021, 2022, and 2023.
History
The inaugural Picklesburgh festival took place on July 17 and 18, 2015, on the Rachel Carson Bridge in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Organized by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, a non-profit organization, and sponsored primarily by Pittsburgh-based Heinz (now Kraft Heinz), the festival was inspired by Pittsburgh's rich history of pickling. Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership president Jeremy Waldrup explained that pickles "speak to the ethnic, cultural history of Pittsburgh, as a melting pot for Eastern European ethnic communities", although numerous countries of Western culture with significant diasporas in the United States, like Germany and Poland, also employ pickling in their national cuisines. According to Waldrup, the festival was also inspired by the growing farm-to-table movement and the trend of urban homesteading.
At Picklesburgh 2016, the second annual festival held at Rachel Carson Bridge, Heinz debuted their first new pickle flavors in over 50 years. The 2017 festival was held at the nearby Roberto Clemente Bridge, where it also took place in 2018 and 2019, gradually taking up more abutting street space each year. Having begun as a two-day festival in 2015, a three-day schedule was established in 2018, which was further expanded to four days in 2024. Picklesburgh was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it returned in August 2021 with additional safety precautions on the Andy Warhol Bridge.
In 2022, the festival returned to its original locale on the Rachel Carson Bridge, with food vendors along the neighboring 10th Street Bypass. Picklesburgh 2022 drew 90,000 attendees, leading organizers to periodically close the Rachel Carson Bridge to prevent overcrowding. Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership director Jack Dougherty remarked, "At times, especially during our peak hours, it would get very crowded and just kind of become a little uncomfortable for everyone in attendance."
In response, for its 2023 installment, the festival was relocated to a larger venue occupying three blocks of the Boulevard of the Allies between Stanwix Street and Smithfield Street, and along Market Street into PPG Place. Even with its larger location, Picklesburgh 2023 still saw enormous shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, with attendance more than doubling to 200,000 visitors. Amid mid-summer heat and huge crowds, 16 attendees were hospitalized due to heat exhaustion and other ailments.
Pickle juice drinking competition
Contestants prepare for the pickle juice drinking competition at Picklesburgh 2022
Since its founding in 2015, every Picklesburgh festival has featured a pickle juice drinking competition as its headline event. In the competition, contestants race to drink a quart-sized jar of pickle juice without regurgitating, spilling, or leaving any juice in the jar. The winner is dubbed the "Mayor of Picklesburgh" and receives a belt and a $500 cash prize, as of 2023.
The 2023 champion and reigning "Mayor of Picklesburgh" is Pittsburgh native Dan Koba, who drank the jar of pickle juice in 7 seconds. The all-time record was set at Picklesburgh 2022, when Wisconsin-based TikTok content creator Jalen Franko won the competition by drinking the quart of juice in 4.5 seconds.

PITTSBURGH BLUES AND ROOTS FESTIVAL
The Pittsburgh Blues and Roots Festival is an American music festival that features local and nationally renowned blues musicians in performance in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is one of the region's "marquee annual concerts."
History
The inaugural event took place at the Riverplex at Sandcastle Waterpark, and since then has been held at Hartwood Acres Park and at the Iron City Brewing Company factory.
Proceeds from the event benefit charity. The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank had been the recipient of the proceeds until 2017 when Band Together Pittsburgh, a local nonprofit that teaches those on the autism spectrum all about playing, writing, recording and even DJing music. It offers programs throughout the year to help those on the spectrum learn the magic of music. It is now held yearly at The Shriners Pavilion in Cheswick, Pennsylvania and is held over two days in the summer.
There was no fesival in 2020.
Previous acts
Many musicians have previously performed at the Pittsburgh Blues Festival: Koko Taylor, Taj Mahal, John Mayall, Gatemouth Brown, Devon Allman, Bernard Allison, Guy Davis, and Robert Cray.

PITTSBURGH FOLK FESTIVAL
The Pittsburgh Folk Festival is a large multicultural celebration of diverse international ethnic heritages, which has been held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania since 1956.
The festival's early mission statement was described in May 1959, as follows, by The Zajednicar, the official newspaper of the Croatian Federal Union of America:
"Being under the auspices of the Duquesne University, the Festival is a non-profit venture dedicated to a closer relationship of the present day citizenry and a better appreciation of their contribution to Pittsburgh growth, especially on the occasion of the bi-centennial year."
History
Initially sponsored by Duquesne University, this festival has been held annually since 1956. Various cultures have been represented, since that time through music, folk dance, and performances on the main stage while different vendors sell traditional food as well as arts and crafts during the festival.
1950s
In 1956, the first festival was held at the Syria Mosque, beginning at 5 p.m. each day on Saturday and Sunday, June 9 and 10. Food booths were located on the mosque's ground floor with multicultural exhibits of history, crafts and products displayed in the mosque's upstairs lobby. On Saturday, the two-hour program, which began at 8 p.m., featured dances, folk singers and storytellers from Scottish, Hungarian, Bulgarian, American, Croatian, Russian, Slovak, Greek, ad German traditions while the Sunday program featured Italian, Lithuanian, Lebanese, Carpatho-Russian, Polish, Irish, Israeli, Chinese, and Ukrainian cultural performances.
The theme of the third annual festival, which was also held at the Syria Mosque, was "Unity in Diversity: Democracy and Beauty; Fun and Friendliness!" It was held from Friday, May 9 through Sunday, May 11, 1958.
Held again at the Syria Mosque in 1959, the fourth annual event began at 5 p.m. each night from Friday May 15 through Sunday, May 17. Friday evening's performances represented Swiss, Indian, Italian, Lithuanian, Scottish, and Hungarian traditions while Slovak, German, Croatian, Chinese, Ukrainian, and Greek groups performed on Saturday, and Bulgarian, Irish, Mexican, Lebanese, Carpatho-Russian, and Polish groups closed out the festival on Sunday. General admission tickets were $1.50 per person. More than 3,000 people attended that year's opening day events.
1960s
In 1962, Robert Morris Junior College took over sponsorship of the festival.
The tenth annual festival included "a French show and French booths" for the first time. The event was held again at the Syria Mosque in May of 1966.
By 1967, the festival had grown so large that it was moved to Pittsburg's Civic Arena.
1970
In 1976, which was both the twentieth anniversary of the Pittsburgh Folk Festival and the year in which the United States Bicentennial was celebrated, newspapers across the country reported that Pittsburgh's annual multicultural event had become one of its nation's largest outdoor festivals. Festival operators received $22,000 in state funds via the Allegheny County Bicentennial Commission that year to add two days to the event's schedule and provide free admission to students and senior citizens.
More than thirty thousand people were expected to attend the festival in 1977.
1980s
In 1985, festival planners introduced several new features, including an International Bazaar, where attendees could purchase "authentic ethnic artifacts," and a new family ticket plan that allowed parents to purchase admission for two adults and two children for nine dollars, for a savings of six dollars off the standard general price of admission. That year, attendance figures declined sixteen percent, from the 38,000 visitors it had attracted in 1984 to 32,000. Planners faulted a decision by Pittsburgh city officials to allow the scheduling of a free carnival event for children on the same day of the 1985 festival at Three Rivers Stadium.
For the festival's thirtieth anniversary in 1986, longtime festival organizers Charles and Carol Cubelic programmed the event to highlight the histories and cultures of India, Korea and Poland, with India's extensive programming timed to coincide with the Festival of India Exhibition that was touring the United States at the time, after having opened at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
Carol Cubelic took over as director of the festival in October 1989 when her husband's health declined sharply. He died from cancer shortly afterward on October 29, 1989. The 1989 Pittsburgh Folk Festival, the final event overseen by Charles Cubelic, was one of the most successful in the festival's history, attracting more than forty thousand attendees during its three-day run.
1990s
The thirty-fourth annual Pittsburgh Folk Festival, the first under the leadership of Carole Cubelic, was held from May 25 to 27, 1989. "I came to Pittsburgh in 1992. And when I married my late husband, I married this festival," she said when interviewed by The Pittsburgh Press the day before the festival's Memorial Day weekend opening. The theme of that year's festival was "A Taste of the Old World." Live cooking demonstrations were sponsored by Equitable Gas.
In 1992, Robert Morris College ended its sponsorship of the festival, citing that it had lost twenty to thirty thousand dollars over the thirty-year period that it had sponsored the event. As a result, Carole Cubelic, who had been employed by the college as a student accounts administrator while also serving as assistant director and then director of the Pittsburgh Folk Festival, stepped down from her role as festival director. The college subsequently transferred the Pittsburgh Folk Festival Corporation to the nineteen groups that had collectively provided the cultural performances, food and volunteer staffing for the festival for nearly forty years. Additionally, negotiations with the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, which had been the festival's venue for many years, turned difficult when center managers began pushing festival planners to "expand the event into an ethnic food fair," which event planners feared would ruin the festival's food reputation with increased participation of inauthentic, carnival-style pizza and Italian sausage stands. Convention center executives also planned to double or triple charges for booth rentals and utility use while proposing that the $6 general admission fee be cut in half, which would have eliminated a source of revenue for the multicultural groups hoping to participate in the event. In response, the festival's new organizers moved the 36th annual event from the convention center to the Melody Tent and Amphitheater at Station Square, which was operated by the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation. Held again on Memorial Day weekend, event planners hoped to attract a crowd of forty to fifty thousand attendees.
Festival leadership changed again the following year with Nan Krushinski taking the helm as festival administrator on behalf of Pittsburgh Folk Festival Inc., the business organization formed by the multiple cultural organizations that had been involved in presenting the festival over the years. Still scheduled on Memorial Day weekend, the 37th annual event was held, for the first time in its history, at a venue outside of Pittsburgh city limits. Opening at the Pittsburgh Expo Mart in Monroeville on Friday, May 28, 1993, the festival launched a new entertainment plan with three stages changing various presenters every thirty minutes as the stages operated continuously throughout each festival day. Ticket prices were set at five dollars for adults (four dollars for senior citizens), and three dollars for children aged three to twelve.
By the time of its fortieth anniversary in 1996, the Pittsburgh Folk Festival had returned to the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in the city's downtown. The festival's head that year was Angela Lipchick.
Fiftieth anniversary (2006)
Still held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh in 2006, the Pittsburgh Folk Festival celebrated its fiftieth anniversary by inviting the participation of twenty-five different ethnic groups, five of which (Bulgaria, Greece, Lebanon, Lithuania, and Ukraine) had been represented every year since the festival's founding in 1956. The Rev. James Root chaired that year's event. Walter Kolar, a member of the festival since its founding, developed a fiftieth-anniversary display.
Present day
In 2016, festival organizers celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the Pittsburgh Folk Festival in conjunction with the city of Pittsburgh's bicentennial celebrations. It was held over Labor Day weekend, from September 3 to 4, in the Schenley Plaza Tent in Oakland. More than forty distinct cultures from twenty different countries were celebrated with Bhutan, Egypt, Mexico, and Venezuela represented for the first time in the event's history. Admission was free.
There was no festival in 2020. Resumption of the festival happened a year later.

PITTSBURGH THREE RIVERS REGATTA
The Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta, named for the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio Rivers at Pittsburgh, is an annual motorboat and river festival held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The festival was first held in 1978 and is often host to an F1 ChampBoat Series race. The F1 race, originally held in 1982, was the first F1 power boat race held in the United States. 2008 saw the return of F1 Power Boat racing at the Pittsburgh Regatta after a two-year hiatus following the 2005 festival. The festival had been scheduled to coincide with the July 4th holiday, however 2016 saw a return to the Regatta being held prior in early August, as it traditionally was prior to 2004. The festival is the largest inland regatta in the United States, drawing tens of thousands of fans along the Allegheny River. The F1 race course consists of a 4-pin 1.25 (2 km) course. In 2008, the Pittsburgh regatta F1 ChampBoat race was nationally broadcast on the Speed Channel.
The Regatta is the annual continuation of the original speed boat and paddle wheeler races of the "Pittsburgh Welcome Week Regatta" held annually starting on May 21, 1949, and through the mid-1950s.

The race corresponds to a three-day festival in downtown Pittsburgh consisting of variety of events including free concerts, food vendors, aerial competitions, various water sports, dragon boat races, and the July Fourth fireworks display for the City of Pittsburgh. Over 1.5 million people are estimated to have attended some aspect of the regatta events every year.
1988 Accident
On August 7, 1988, one of the Formula 1 boats went out of control and crashed into a crowd near Three Rivers Stadium. A 7-year-old boy was killed, and 24 were injured. The accident was captured on live TV during the broadcast of a Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets baseball game from a blimp above the stadium.
The Kinks
On August 7, 1993, The Kinks were playing in the nearby I.C. Light Amphitheater. After contending with noises from the regatta, and particularly a firework set, lead singer Ray Davies improvised a song called "Regatta My Ass"

PITTSBURGH WHISKEY & FINE SPIRITS FESTIVAL
The Pittsburgh Whiskey & Fine Spirits Festival is an annual festival celebrating whiskey and spirits in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The festival is sponsored by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. Contributions to the event benefit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The Pittsburgh festival follows a similar one in Philadelphia. The creation of the festival follows the success of the Pittsburgh Wine Festival. It was conceived as an "experiential marketplace for spirits." It was founded in 2007, amid growth in whiskey's popularity.
The inaugural event in 2007 focused on featuring whiskeys, ryes and vodkas, which are meant to be consumed "neat." The theme was the Whiskey Rebellion, an important event in Western Pennsylvania history, with information on the history of ryes and whiskeys. In 2008, the offerings were expanded to include cocktails. That year, the sponsors sought to reach the female demographic. The 2009 event sought to reach an even broader audience, especially younger individuals. The 2010 event had a speakeasy decor, with a new focus on cigars.
For the first time, the 2011 edition, which had a Mad Men theme, sold out all tickets prior to the beginning of the event. Wigle Whiskey, a new Pittsburgh distillery, was to have been featured, but federal authorities had not yet approved the brand's label design. The "Adult Chocolate Milk" specialty drink was well received

PITTSBURGH WINE FESTIVAL
The Pittsburgh Wine Festival is an annual festival celebrating wine in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The festival is sponsored by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, which maintains an on-site wine shop. The Pittsburgh festival follows a similar one in Philadelphia.
The first event was held in 2003, amid some questioning whether a "beer city" like Pittsburgh could sustain a wine festival. It is now well established, however, and the festival receives generally positive reviews from wine critics. In fact, tickets usually sell out. It was named to the Top 10 list of wine events in the United States by the Quarterly Review of Wines. Its success inspired the Pittsburgh Whiskey & Fine Spirits Festival.
Proceeds from the festival benefit charity. By the fourth year, in 2007, the festival had raised over $400,000 for charity. By 2009, that figure had grown to $6 million, with large portions going to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

The name change reflects the city of Pittsburgh's efforts to clean itself up over the years and shed its smoky past while still celebrating the people who helped make it what it is today.
2020 saw no festival caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; the 13th was deferred to 2021.
