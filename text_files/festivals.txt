Museum opening its doors to the public, the year will start off with an anniversary exhibition presenting 65 artists from
the museum collection. At 65 years, the Museum is thinking about its role and responsibility to foster conversations that will

join us on this forward-looking journey, celebrating 65 years of art, culture, and community at The Westmoreland.October 18, 2024 to

Pittsburgh's nightmares and of all things that go bump in the night. Join us for a spine-tingling, outdoor, walking ghost
tour of one of America's most haunted cities. We'll take you as close to as many haunted sites as we
can and regale you with Pittsburgh's greatest ghost stories. We know where all the bodies are buried! Pittsburgh has a
North Side and a South Side--we take you to its dark side. Tours run rain or shine. The tour meets
at the Grant Street side of the City-County Building by the Mayor Caliguiri statue. Tour runs Fridays and Saturdays, from
May to early November, with additional dates in October. For more information and to purchase tickets visit: www.hauntedpittsburghtours.comOctober 18, 2024
to January 20, 2025KAWS + WarholIn celebration of its 30th anniversary, The Warhol presents KAWS + Warhol, the first exhibition
to examine the dark themes present in the work of both artists. From skulls to car crashes, both artists deploy
their signature bright colors and pop culture references while also presenting the lurid spectacle of death. The dark undercurrents in
the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for
the first time. KAWS will also respond to Warhol’s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures,
and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some
of America’s most loved cereal boxes including Reese’s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will be juxtaposed with
Warhol’s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children. In response to The Warhol’s new initiative The
Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible
from its entrance space.KAWS + Warhol is presented by UNIQLO Major support provided by Nemacolin, Jim Spencer & Michael Lin,
and Kathe & Jim Patrinos. Media Sponsor: Orange Barrel Media Image: Background: Andy Warhol, Ambulance Disaster, 1964-65, Contribution Dia Center

to December 8, 2024The Great Search: Art in a Time of Change, 1928–1945The Great Search: Art in a Time of
Change, 1928–1945 surveys the period from the beginning of the Great Depression to the end of World War II to
demonstrate how pluralism was a hallmark of the modern American art world. This exhibition features works by Andrew Wyeth, Arthur
Dove, Milton Avery, and others. The Great Search‘s title references American Art Today, the World’s Fair exhibition held in New
York City in 1939. Organizer Holger Cahill, then national director of the Federal Art Project, spoke in his address of
the modern artist’s “search that takes many paths”—a yearning desire to seek out new and enduring forms that would aid
democracy. One of The Westmoreland’s best-known and loved paintings, Ernest Fiene’s Night Shift, Aliquippa (1936), was included in this pivotal
presentation. Drawn primarily from The Westmoreland’s collection, amplified by key loans from public and private collections, the exhibition will provide
fresh insight into the individuals, experiences, and both new and traditional aesthetics that define American modern art.This exhibition is organized
by Jeremiah William McCarthy, Chief Curator, The Westmoreland Museum of American Art.This is one in a series of American art
exhibitions created through a multi-year, multi-institutional partnership formed by the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of the Art Bridges
Cohort Program. Generously supported by The Heinz Endowments.October 18, 2024 to March 2, 2025Art[Work]Art museums are places of inspiration not
only for their visitors but also for their staff, many of whom are artists themselves. ART[WORK] showcases the talent of
the individuals who keep The Westmoreland running. From collage to linocut and HR to PR, the staff pursues their passion
for art both on and off the clock.October 18, 2024 to November 8, 2024 5:00 PM –8:00 PMShaping the Future:

Sculptors, featuring fifteen works from award-winning, up-and-coming sculptors from across the nation. Ranging from candy-painted reimaginings of cultural icons to

hours are Fridays and Saturdays from 12pm to 6pm, plus special programming Shaping the Future: National Showcase of Emerging Sculptors

Gouges - Rhonny Dam Marianne Angelle - Myriah Cross Charlotte Corday - Sarah Baker Marie Antoinette - Jenn Rian Synopsis:
Four beautiful, badass women lose their heads in this irreverent, girl-powered comedy set during the French Revolution’s Reign of Terror.
Playwright Olympe de Gouges, assassin Charlotte Corday, former queen (and fan of ribbons) Marie Antoinette, and Haitian rebel Marianne Angelle
hang out, murder Marat, and try to beat back the extremist insanity in 1793 Paris. This grand and dream-tweaked comedy
is about violence and legacy, art and activism, feminism and terrorism, compatriots and chosen sisters, and how we actually go
about changing the world. It’s a true story. Or total fiction. Or a play about a play. Or a raucous
resurrection…that ends in a song and a scaffold. 💵 Don't forget to bring cash! We have a 50/50 raffle, a
French-themed raffle basket, and concessions available for purchase throughout the evening. 🚪 Doors open at 7PM for the 7:30PM evening

TACO FESTIVAL
About us
The Pittsburgh Taco Festival® is an annual food festival aimed at celebrating (and eating) TACOS, as well as supporting and raising funds and awareness for the city’s Latin-American community.
history
The Original Pittsburgh Taco Festival® was founded in 2016 by Craig McCloud who sought to create an opportunity which benefitted food trucks/start-ups as well as support non-profits that serve the city’s burgeoning Latin American population. The festival regularly attracts vendors from beyond the metro area, as well as visitors who plan weekend visits from New York, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, and beyond. Over the years, tens of thousands of people have joined us for what has become an annually anticipated cultural and community event. We hope you’ll join us, too!
partners
In addition to the many corporate and national sponsors that support our mission, we are most proud of our cultural partnerships. We work closely with Pittsburgh Hispanic Development Corporation (PHDC) and Casa San Jose, because we wish to honor the cultures responsible for what we consider the ‘greatest hand-food known to man.’ These organizations help us recruit vendors, organize entertainment, and provide authenticity to our taco-themed event. In turn they receive a generous percentage of the net proceeds.

LITTLE ITALY DAYS
Little Italy Days started in 2002 to celebrate Bloomfield’s Italian heritage, and create a destination spot for Italian-themed entertainment and food. The event has grown through the years and is now lasts four days.
Sal Richetti, who was born and raised in Bloomfield has produced the event since 2012. Sal grew up in Bloomfield, attended Immaculate Conception grade school and Central Catholic High School. He is a local musician who has been performing for over 30 years in the tri-state area, and is the owner of Big Day Entertainment, located in the Strip District, since 1995. He is no stranger to the festival, having booked the entertainment in previous years. In 2013 he expanded it to four days. Previously, the event was always held in September, since 2013 it has mooved to August. “I wanted to give vendors more opportunity with the longer daylight, additionally; there is less chance of cold weather”
“I am excited and honored to produce this community oriented event in the community where I was born and raised. I want to be able to produce Little Italy Days so the businesses can benefit from the large crowds and everyone else including residents, organizations, schools and churches can become involved.”

BANANA SPLIT FESTIVAL
History
The story of the All-American dessert that started in Latrobe
Since its invention in 1904, the Banana Split has become an iconic part of American dessert culture. Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old “soda jerk” at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream – typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry – and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit!
The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler’s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as “Dr. Dave’s” among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert.
Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry.
Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90.
In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split,  “Ice-Cream Joe” Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler’s invention with the “From Pitt Came the Split” Event.
The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel’s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record.
Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania!
Honorary Chair
Ice Cream Joe Gruble
The legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town’s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the “From Pitt Came the Split” event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013.
From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration’s honorary chair.
