As Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the 2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival, Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour, starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus. Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, and others.

Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, following decades of close collaboration. Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss, Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Th tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg Festival. In 2020, Beethoven s anniversary year, he conducted a new staging of Fidelio 1806 version at the Theater an der Wien. In autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, leading a revival of Mozart s Idomeneo. Beyond the podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites, including Jan ek s Jen fa, Strauss s Elektra, Dvo k s Rusalka as well as Puccini's Turandot which he regularly performs around the globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss s Salome, was premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023. As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Z rich, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty years. In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on the music of this composer. Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International Classical Music Awards declared him Artist of the Year. Please do not shorten or revise without permission of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide. As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca Recondita armonia . The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa Non la sospiri la nostra casetta . Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her Qual occhio al mondo . When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power Va, Tosca . ACT II. In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will Ha pi forte sapore . The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny Vittoria and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love Vissi d arte . Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man s hand. ACT III. The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair E lucevan le stelle . Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave the bullets were real. When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death. -Adapted from Opera News We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances Here are some details and resources to help. a0Also visit our a0Opera FAQs a0or our a0Accessibility page.

She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army. When he returned and found her married to Alfio, he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola. Later in the morning, a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia, Turiddu s mother, who tells her that her son is away buying wine. But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village. Alfio arrives with a group of men, boasting of his horses and of Lola. He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine. When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more, Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning. Lucia is surprised, but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet. As the villagers follow the procession to church, Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia. The old woman expresses her pity, then also leaves for Mass. Turiddu arrives in the piazza. When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola, he denies her accusations. Just then Lola passes by on her way to church. She mocks Santuzza, and Turiddu turns to follow her. Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her. Refusing to listen, Turiddu leaves, and Santuzza curses him. Alfio appears, late for Mass. Santuzza tells him that Lola went to church with Turiddu and reveals that she has been cheating on him. In a rage, Alfio swears to get even and rushes off, leaving behind the now conscience-stricken Santuzza. Returning from the church the villagers gather at Mamma Lucia s tavern. Turiddu leads them in a drinking song, but the atmosphere becomes tense when Alfio appears. He refuses Turiddu s offer of wine and instead challenges him to a knife fight. Turiddu admits his guilt but is determined to go through with the fight, for Santuzza s sake as well as for his honor. The two men agree to meet outside the village. Alone with his mother, Turiddu begs her to take care of Santuzza if he doesn t come back, then runs off to a0the fight. As Mamma Lucia waits anxiously, shouts are heard in the distance. A woman runs in screaming that Turiddu has been killed. PAGLIACCI PROLOGUE Tonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people. ACT I The same Sicilian village, 1949. a0A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio, the head of the troupe, advertises the night s performance to the gathered crowd. One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio s young wife, Nedda. Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage life and theater are not the same. As the crowd disperses, Nedda is left alone, disturbed by her husband s jealousy. She looks up to the sky, envying the birds their freedom. Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda, but she beats him back, and he retreats, swearing revenge. In fact, Nedda does have a lover Silvio, a young peasant, who suddenly appears. The two reaffirm their love, and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night. Tonio, who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation, alerts Canio, but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized. Canio violently threatens Nedda, but she refuses to reveal her lover s name. Beppe, another member of the troupe, restrains Canio, and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening s performance to catch the culprit. Alone, Canio gives in to his despair he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking. ACT II That evening, the villagers assemble to watch the performance, Silvio among them. Beppe plays Harlequin, who serenades Columbine, played by Nedda. He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo, played by Tonio, and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine s husband Pagliaccio, played by Canio. When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears, Harlequin slips away. Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife s innocence, which ignites Canio s jealousy. Forgetting his role and the play, he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover. She tries to continue with the performance, the audience enthralled by its realism, until Canio snaps. In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio, who rushes to her aid. Turning to the horrified crowd, Tonio announces that the comedy is over.

As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night. Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him. Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son s crime, but one of the paintings Lucien Freud s Woman With Eyes Closed looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young.

The police, the media, and the museum s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief Thomas has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona. In her son s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular Lucian Freud s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother s death have reverberated throughout Mona s life. The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly. Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona s future. With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings whilesimultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go. - courtesy of the creators We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances Here are some details and resources to help. a0Also visit our a0Opera FAQs a0or our a0Accessibility page.

During his tenure he has considerably expanded the company s repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Opera s high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded the a0Resident Artist Program a0to include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move to a0Bitz Opera Factory a0in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there. Pittsburgh Opera's a0current Music Director, a0Antony Walker, was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the company s musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note. Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here. Our Beginnings Founded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburgh s Tuesday Musical Club a0pianist a0Virginia C. Byerly contralto a0Carolyn Hunt Mahaffey a0Priscilla W. Collins a0Ruby N. Wickersham and a0Marie M. Pease, these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States. The first production, in March 1940 at a0Carnegie Music Hall, was a0The Tales of Hoffmann, a0with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. a0The company s first conductor, a0Richard Karp a0of Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the company s move to Heinz Hall in 1971. In 1983, a0Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Opera s General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera. Mark Weinstein s appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the company s growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning. He increased the company s assets threefold and cemented the Opera s reputation as a leader in financial management in the region. Weinstein initiated the Artistic Excellence Project, and raised major funds which led to the appointment of Christopher Hahn as Artistic Director in 2000 and a0John Mauceri a0as Music Director in 2001. Our New Home In 2008 Pittsburgh Opera moved to its current and a0permanent home in the Strip District, finally achieving the space to house the resources needed to better prepare for performances at the Benedum, while opening new ways for a0the community to experience all the artistry that is part of opera. In an effort to maintain the Company s mission to enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, the Opera has committed to the use of sustainable methods in the renovation and maintenance of the Bitz Opera Factory, obtaining a a0Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED Operations and Maintenance Silver Certification a0in June 2011. In addition to its mainstage productions, Pittsburgh Opera produces a range of programs to engage and enrich the community, with more than 15,000 students, families and educators participating in its a0educational events a0annually. The internationally-renowned Pittsburgh Opera a0Resident Artist Program a0is among the country s top five training centers for rising opera stars and the newly a0designed administrative and rehearsal space provides a0for events ranging from free community a0Song Shop Concerts a0to concert recitals by world-class opera singers.

When I came to the museum in 2015, I was struck by the legacy of this institution, as well as Pittsburgh. I was and continue to be taken with the city. From its history and people to the artistic community, the Steel City has depth, heart, and dedication. It truly stands out on an international map. As one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Museum of Art began as the vision of Andrew Carnegie, and his initial concept was to create a museum that would bring the world to the people of Pittsburgh. He achieved this aspiration by creating the very first Carnegie International exhibition in 1896, as a gift to those living and working in the city. More than 125 years later, through collecting art via each Carnegie International, the longest-running North American survey of international art, and through our many other creative activities, we continue to expand the imaginative potential of what a museum can be. For so many reasons, including its extraordinary exhibition program, diverse collection, talented staff, passionate volunteers, and dedicated supporters, I believe that this museum is one of the most dynamic visual art institutions in America, and I m so proud to be its tenth director. Since becoming director in 2020, my vision for the museum has been to celebrate what makes it distinct from any other museum in the world: that Carnegie Museum of Art has been and continues to be a living archive of the art of its time. We showcase the work of artists relevant to local and immediate concerns, and through our interdisciplinary research, we strive to situate their innovations within a broader picture of the world today. The museum s collection of some 100,000 works provides an inspiring context for this essential work. Our ultimate purpose is to make space for expansive inquiry into the art and ideas that shape our time, so that we may offer artists and audiences transformative experiences right here in Pittsburgh and beyond. My sincere hope is that our museum may offer you an experience that is meaningful and shared with others. I look forward to seeing you in our galleries, and if you happen to cross paths with me, please say hello Yours, Eric Crosby Henry J. Heinz II Director, Carnegie Museum of Art Vice President, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh', 'In 1895, Andrew Carnegie, the Scotland-born philanthropist and titan of the steel industry, founded the Carnegie Institute, now Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, alongside Carnegie Library in a shared building in the heart of the Oakland neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Conceived as a gift to the city and dedicated to the pursuits of art, music, literature, and natural science, Carnegie s monument, as he called it, immediately became one of the most significant cultural institutions in the nation. The Institute is but one of many existing institutions, foundations, and endowments that carry on his philanthropic legacy to this day. Carnegie Museum of Art is one of four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, along with Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center, and The Andy Warhol Museum. Together, the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh strive to preserve and expand the resources of art and science as agents of personal growth and social advancement in Pittsburgh and beyond. Carnegie International Since 1896, the Carnegie International has been Carnegie Museum of Art s most significant exhibition as well as its leading contribution to the field. With each iteration, the museum creates new contexts for understanding the art of our time, connecting ever-changing publics with artists who give personal expression to the urgencies of our moment. What began as a juried show in its early years is now an ambitious curatorial initiative with aspirations beyond the museum s walls. The International s previous iterations have left an indelible mark not only on the museum and the communities it serves but more broadly on the history of exhibition making. With each International, the museum writes another chapter in that history, transforming our understanding of how cultural institutions create space for meaning and experience. Learn More Our Collection Grows The museum, under the leadership of successive directors and curators, has embarked on an intentional and expansive program to broaden its collecting areas by focusing both on the art of its time and important historical material. Andrew Carnegie conceived of an exhibition what would become the first Carnegie International in 1896 from which the museum would collect artworks instead of enriching the museum with Carnegie s own collection. Paintings by Winslow Homer, Camille Pissarro, Edward Hopper, and others were the seed from which this incredible collection now has grown. a0Since then, the museum has acquired hundreds of works of art that have appeared in the exhibition series from artists such as Doris Salcedo, Hiroshi Sugimoto, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, and many more. During the 1960s and 1970s, museum leadership conducted a significant campaign to continue growing the historical collection, working closely with philanthropist Sarah Mellon Scaife, and with her family after her death in 1965, to identify a remarkable group of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works. a0Building on existing holdings in decorative arts, a gift of some 2,800 objects from the estate of Ailsa Mellon Bruce in 1970 firmly established the museum s commitment to collecting functional and design objects spanning cultures and time periods. While the museum has stewarded an impressive architectural cast collection since 1907, it did not begin to grow its collection of architectural drawings, prints, and models from the 19th century to the present until 1993, when the museum founded the Heinz Architectural Center through the generosity of the Drue Heinz Foundation. In 2001, the museum acquired the archive of Pittsburgh-born photographer Charles Teenie Harris, consisting of more than 70,000 photographic negatives spanning from the 1930s to the 1970s. A dedicated Charles Teenie Harris Advisory Committee helps identify the photographs along with the help of visitors and community members. Learn More About the Archive Our Story Continues With its collection held in the public trust, the museum stands as an invaluable creative resource for the Pittsburgh region and the world. With each new addition to the collection, we hope our visitors share in celebrating the promise of many possible futures for Carnegie Museum of Art.', 'In June 2021, Carnegie Museum of Art embarked on a year-long strategic visioning process that brought together knowledge and experiences from individuals across the museum, the Pittsburgh region, and national and international art world to reflect on the museum s legacy, opportunities, challenges, and ambitions. The below strategic framework is the result of this visioning process. It guides our decision-making and it charts a dynamic and energizing future, transforming the museum s relationship to the audiences it serves and the art histories it narrates. Our Mission Carnegie Museum of Art creates experiences that connect people to art, ideas, and one another. At Carnegie Museum of Art, we believe creativity is a defining human characteristic to which everyone should have access. Carnegie Museum of Art collects, preserves, and presents artworks from around the world to inspire, sustain, and provoke discussion, and to engage and reflect multiple audiences. Our Values As one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Museum of Art embraces the Core Values of the larger institute: Our Statement of Purpose Driven by curiosity, Carnegie Museum of Art makes space for expansive inquiry into the art and ideas that shape our time. Underpinning our organizational mission and values, our purpose articulates the museum s reason for being, or the central why we do what we do. This purpose is our guiding principle for our staff, leadership, advisory board, volunteers, and community partners as we forge ahead. Our Value Proposition A Confluence of Creative Possibilities As the nation s first museum dedicated to collecting the art of its time, Carnegie Museum of Art is a meeting place for Pittsburgh and the world. Through the Carnegie International, our collection, artist-centered exhibitions, co-created educational resources, and dynamic public programs, we surface questions with both local and global relevance, building on history s lessons to contemplate, envision, and help manifest brave and imaginative futures. We strive to be an inquisitive and responsive institution, bringing together perspectives from the Pittsburgh region, the broader nation, and the globe to connect our lives to the larger human experience. Guiding Ambitions These three guiding ambitions articulate the long-term, transformational impact we seek to have in the world. Each ambition is accompanied by a core question that we endeavor to answer through our work. Together, these ambitions serve as our compass for aligning the collective efforts of our many stakeholders, ensuring that every initiative and project we undertake contributes to our vision for the future. Expand the Imaginative Capacity of Museum Work How might we exemplify a culture of creative exchange that sparks new possibilities for what a 21st-century museum can be We aim to re-examine inherited narratives, histories, and ways of seeing in order to bring our museum, and the field as a whole, into more robust dialogue with our audiences and communities. By continually interrogating the purpose and field-wide implications of our practices, we seek to evolve and elevate our collection, commissions, programming, and operations in responsive and dynamic ways that model new directions for the field. Catalyze Creative Agency How might we foster inclusive, affirming, and empowering experiences for all who engage with the museum When we choose to welcome art into our lives, we unlock the vital power of creativity to transform ourselves and society. We aim to be an ever-evolving and responsive museum where a multiplicity of perspectives makes our museum experience richer, and where our staff and audiences alike are welcomed, seen, and empowered. Enrich Our Region s Artistic Life How might we extend our impact and the work of local communities and partners through mutually beneficial and sustained relationships We strive to be an active partner in gathering, connecting, and supporting the diverse individuals and organizations that put our region s cultural ecosystem on a national and international map. We commit ourselves to sharing our institutional resources, platform, and knowledge to foster stronger, more equitable, and reciprocal networks that uplift the creative vibrancy of our city and radiate their impact more widely than would be possible alone. Strategic Focus Areas and Priorities To achieve our guiding ambitions and realize our vision for long-term impact, we commit to the following strategic focus areas which will guide our efforts through 2027. Internal Culture: Empowering a diverse and collaborative internal community As a community of colleagues and peers, we value the perspectives and wisdom that exists at all levels of our organization, and strive to champion individual agency, growth, collaboration, and openness in all that we do. We endeavor to be an employer of choice and a supportive training ground for those who are eager to make a robust impact in the world through art. Our Priorities Experience: Reimagining the museum experience to center welcome, access, and dialogue with audiences Building on our commitment to sharing art as an essential form of knowledge with the public, we believe a work of art isn t truly complete without the experience of the viewer. We are committed to listening to and learning from our audiences to ensure access to our collection, programs, and spaces on their own terms. Our Priorities Community: Leveraging the museum s resources to support and advocate for the communities of Pittsburgh As a neighborhood museum and resource, we aim to serve Pittsburgh artists and communities alike with intentionality and responsiveness. We strive to be a porous museum: sharing and activating our platform, assets, and expertise through vibrant and dynamic community partnerships both onsite and off. Our Priorities Field: Expanding the museum s reputation and influence on the world stage For over 125 years, Carnegie Museum of Art has been committed to showcasing the art and artists of the current moment while also building a vital archive of art from the past. From the ambitious execution of the Carnegie International to the daily work of our entire organization, we seek to build on our legacy of thought leadership through rigorous research, adventurous and artist-centered programming and partnerships, and forward-thinking contributions to museum discourse and practice. We are dedicated to fulfilling our role as a deeply local cultural institution that convenes and contributes to the global creative conversation. Our Priorities', 'When the Carnegie Institute opened in 1895, this hybrid institution comprised of museums, a library, and a music hall occupied the grand, historical spaces that would eventually become known as the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and the storied Carnegie Music Hall. The architectural firm behind these historic structures was Longfellow, Alden Harlow, who had close ties to the influential Henry Hobson Richardson, creator of the Allegheny County Courthouse in downtown Pittsburgh. A decade later, the Carnegie Institute underwent a massive expansion, adding galleries, social spaces, and works of art. This addition included the Grand Staircase, adorned with John White Alexander s mural, a0The Crowning of Labor, the Hall of Sculpture, modeled after the Greek Parthenon, and the Hall of Architecture, which presents plaster casts of historic European masterpieces. In 1974, renowned architect Edward Larrabee Barnes added to the grandeur of Carnegie Institute with the Sarah Mellon Scaife Galleries, which expanded the spaces dedicated to Carnegie Museum of Art. Barnes elevated the new galleries to an upper floor and clad them in Norwegian Larvikite stone, with ample natural light streaming in through roof lights. Working in collaboration with the legendary landscape architect Dan Kiley, the exterior spaces of the museum include the Sculpture Court and Fountain Plaza, complete with large-scale outdoor sculptures, such as Richard Serra s Carnegie. During your next visit to the museum, we encourage you to take in the architectural wonders of our building and its surrounding works of art. Built after the Greek Parthenon, the Hall of Sculpture is a must-visit for all sculpture and architecture enthusiasts.

great cultural institutions funded and built by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who made his fortune in Pittsburgh s steel industry. Carnegie s vision was that the museum would exhibit the wonders of nature to everyone from mill workers to affluent society members. When it opened in 1895, the museum s early collections included artifacts from ancient Egypt, beautiful minerals, exotic wildlife taxidermy, and, of course, dinosaurs. Carnegie, an ardent evolutionist, had a particular interest in dinosaurs that fueled paleontology expeditions. In the late 1890s, expeditions to the western United States led to the discovery of a0Diplodocus carnegii a0and many other dinosaurs. Early expeditions yielded more than 400 crates of fossils that kick-started the dinosaur collection that filled the now-famous a0Dinosaurs in Their Time a0hall. As the museum grew and expanded, Carnegie botanists, entomologists, zoologists, anthropologists, and other scientists studying the natural world traveled abroad on expeditions from the Arctic to the Amazon in search of new discoveries and scientific insights. The artifacts, flora, and fauna they collected grew the Carnegie research and display collection from thousands to millions of objects. Continuing this spirit of exploration, but now a little closer to home, the museum established a0Powdermill Nature Reserve a0in 1956. The new field station and laboratory in Rector, Pennsylvania helped museum researchers do long-term studies of natural populations in western Pennsylvania. More than 100 years after Carnegie s initial gift, Carnegie Museum of Natural History remains a place of scientific inquiry and a world class public institution. As species die out and habitats decline, a new emphasis has been placed on conservation. By displaying nature s wonders, museum leaders hope to spark conversation about the inherent worth of nature and to inspire a new generation of scientists to conserve both the planet and Carnegie s vision.

It is the largest museum in North America dedicated to a single artist. The museum holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives from the Pittsburgh-born pop art icon Andy Warhol . The Andy Warhol Museum is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and is a collaborative project of the Carnegie Institute , the Dia Art Foundation and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts AWFVA. Warhol Self Portrait Exhibit in 2010 The museum is located in an 88,000-square-foot 8,200 m facility on seven floors. Containing 17 galleries, the museum features 900 paintings, close to 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and over 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Its most recent operating budget 2010 was 6.1 million. In addition to its Pittsburgh location the museum has sponsored 56 traveling exhibits that have attracted close to nine million visitors in 153 venues worldwide since 1996. Plans for the museum were announced in October 1989, about 2 years after Warhol's death. At the time of the announcement, works worth an estimated 80 million were donated to the newly announced museum by the AWFVA and the Dia Art Foundation. Thomas N. Armstrong III , who had been the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1974 to 1990, was named the museum's first director in 1993. Matt Wrbican joined the staff of the museum before it opened, inventorying Warhol's belongings in New York, and has become the archivist and an expert on Warhol's work. By 1993, the 88,000-square-foot 8,200 m industrial warehouse and its extensive renovations had cost about 12 million, and the AWFVA had donated more than 1,000 of Warhol's works worth over 55 million, a donation that grew to about 3,000 works. On May 13 14, 1994, the museum attracted about 25,000 visitors to its opening weekend. Armstrong, its founding director, resigned nine months after its opening at the time of his resignation, the museum had had tense relations with the AWFVA and the Carnegie Institute, its financial backer, though The New York Times could find no one involved who would say whether that friction played a role in Armstrong's resignation. On November 1, 1997, the AWFVA donated all Warhol film and video copyrights to the museum. In 2013, it was announced that in Manhattan , New York City , in the Essex Crossing development on the Lower East Side , an annex to the main Pittsburgh museum was scheduled to open by 2017. However, the museum announced in March 2015 that it had dropped its plans to open the New York annex. In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Lou Reed , based on Warhol's 1975 book, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again , was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the museum in Pittsburgh. In 2022, the museum announced a 60 million expansion deemed The 'Pop District' covering six blocks in Pittsburgh, PA. The expansion looks to build a music venue, a social media studio called Warhol Creative, and expand places for public art exhibits. The proposed site would be around 58,000 square feet 17,500 square meters, including a first-floor concert venue with standing room for up to 1,000 people, a second-floor mezzanine, and an events space that could hold up to 360 people on the fourth floor. The third floor would be used for offices and support spaces. The project is expected to take ten years and is funded primarily through local foundations. Display of Interview magazine covers The 2010 film She's Out of My League filmed a key scene at the museum during an evening event. The film's subject was hosting the event. The Andy Warhol Diaries TV series in 2022 prominently featured museum staff as narrators of Warhol's life.

Two new light rail stations opened in the spring of 2012. The North Side station is located beside PNC Park and near the north portal of the Allegheny River Tunnel . Allegheny station is located by Acrisure Stadium and is the current western terminus of the line. In October 2014, two 11-story office skyscrapers were proposed for the area by local parking lot manager Alco Parking. The project is likely to move forward, as soon as an anchor tenant can be found. North Shore runs along the Allegheny River and its confluence with the Monongahela River to form the Ohio River . It is bordered by Chateau to the west, Allegheny West to the northwest, Allegheny Center to the north, East Allegheny to the northeast, and Troy Hill to the east.

Kamin Science Center , is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . It is located in the Chateau neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium . The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year. Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium which features the latest in digital projection technology, the Rangos Giant Theater promoted as the biggest screen in Pittsburgh, a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University s Robot Hall of Fame in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema, SportsWorks , the Miniature Railroad Village , and the USS Requin a World War II submarine . According to Nicholas Efran, The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years. However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations . In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC 's Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the 10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs. In June of 2022, Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame , such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars , Maria from Metropolis , as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey , were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid , the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage until the Science Center decides what to do with it. Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science , which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States , and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute under the leadership of Robert Wilburn stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the 40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas , which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger. The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991. On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022. It was touted as the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition, with more than 30 interactive displays featuring all things robotic. Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid , the Robothespian, an interactive , animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort. The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2 , C-3PO , Data , the T-800 Terminator , R.O.B. , Maschinenmensch , Gort , Robby the Robot , Robot B-9 , HAL 9000 , and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running . Highmark SportsWorks formerly UPMC SportsWorks is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center. It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate. The main idea of SportsWorks is to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports. SportsWorks features three themed areas: Physics of Sports exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc., LifeWorks featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle, and Sports Challenge demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports. The previous sponsor, UPMC , ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot 1,100 m SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark . It reopened in the Fall of 2009. From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition . At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit. A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit , then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector , an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh. The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri. It was installed in 2000 with a computerized lighting system. In 2008 a storm damaged the cone, thus it underwent upgrades to its lighting system with an addition of energy-efficient bulbs. At night, it is lit with different colors, signalling the weather forecast from WTAE-TV for the coming day.

It has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 6 North ShoreDowntown Neighborhoods. It is on the banks of the Ohio River and is separated from the neighborhood of Manchester by PA Route 65 . As of the 2000 U.S. census, Chateau has a population of 39. A 2006 investigation by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found the neighborhood virtually uninhabited. This may be because the neighborhood mostly consists of warehouses and places of business along the Ohio River. In August 2009, the Rivers Casino opened along the Ohio River in the Chateau neighborhood. Kamin Science Center and the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild are also located in Chateau.

Kamin Science Center , is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . It is located in the Chateau neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium . The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year. Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium which features the latest in digital projection technology, the Rangos Giant Theater promoted as the biggest screen in Pittsburgh, a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University s Robot Hall of Fame in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema, SportsWorks , the Miniature Railroad Village , and the USS Requin a World War II submarine . According to Nicholas Efran, The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years. However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations . In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC 's Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the 10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs. In June of 2022, Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame , such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars , Maria from Metropolis , as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey , were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid , the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage until the Science Center decides what to do with it. Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science , which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States , and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute under the leadership of Robert Wilburn stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the 40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas , which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger. The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991. On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022. It was touted as the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition, with more than 30 interactive displays featuring all things robotic. Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid , the Robothespian, an interactive , animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort. The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2 , C-3PO , Data , the T-800 Terminator , R.O.B. , Maschinenmensch , Gort , Robby the Robot , Robot B-9 , HAL 9000 , and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running . Highmark SportsWorks formerly UPMC SportsWorks is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center. It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate. The main idea of SportsWorks is to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports. SportsWorks features three themed areas: Physics of Sports exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc., LifeWorks featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle, and Sports Challenge demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports. The previous sponsor, UPMC , ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot 1,100 m SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark . It reopened in the Fall of 2009. From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition . At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit. A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit , then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector , an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh. The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri. It was installed in 2000 with a computerized lighting system. In 2008 a storm damaged the cone, thus it underwent upgrades to its lighting system with an addition of energy-efficient bulbs. At night, it is lit with different colors, signalling the weather forecast from WTAE-TV for the coming day.

In contrast to typical natural history museums , it is focused on the collection and exposition of organisms that have been intentionally and heritably altered by humans by means including selective breeding or genetic engineering , a phenomenon referred to as the postnatural . The Center is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge relating to the complex interplay between culture, nature, and biotechnology, whose mission is to acquire, interpret, and provide access to a collection of living, preserved, and documented organisms of postnatural origin. It was founded by Richard Pell, an associate professor of Electronic and Time-based Arts at Carnegie Mellon University . Displays have included GloFish with fluorescence genes from sea coral, 'Biosteel' goats that grow spider silk proteins in their milk, transgenic fruit flies and a Silkie chicken , bred through the continuation of a recessive gene for its fluffy, fur-like coat. Exhibits are narrated via wired telephone handset . A range of formats are used including photography, taxidermy and dioramas, and living exhibits. In addition, the Center has an extensive online archive detailing past and current exhibitions, specimens, archives, events and press releases. Details of past exhibitions include notably those of the Cold Coast Archive, a collection of artefacts and seeds from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault collected by researchers and artists Signe Lid n, Annesofie Norn, and Steve Rowell which was displayed at the Center in 2012 Atomic Age Rodents, an archive of rodents from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History which had been used in some form or another in atomic testing in the early to mid-20th Century and PostNatural Nature, produced in collaboration with the Museum f r Naturkunde in Berlin documenting different instances of the postnatural in everyday organisms. Traveling exhibitions for museums and galleries are also produced. Locations displayed at include the Waag Society in Amsterdam and the Art Laboratory in Berlin. The Center employs a delicate and purposeful aesthetic to the display of their exhibits. It also intentionally uses neutral language so as to invite visitors to go beyond a reactionary impulse to stigma-blighted words, and instead consider the specimens and ideas on a deeper level. The Center for Post Natural history does not offer a celebration of this technological harnessing of the immanence of life, nor is it a simple rejection. Instead it is a careful exploration of how lives might be lived together, asking what might be at stake for subjects, places, practices and politics. In addition, the Center also produces a range of other paraphernalia pertaining to their collections and other conceptions of the postnatural. These include books, T-shirts and postcards, and 3D archival prints which can be purchased on site. In 2015, the Center was featured by National Geographic in their March 2015 The Age of Disbelief issue. Official websiteGarfield is a neighborhood in the East End of the City of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States. Garfield is bordered on the South by Bloomfield and Friendship at Penn Avenue , on the West by the Allegheny Cemetery at Mathilda Street, on the North by Stanton Heights at Mossfield Street, and on the East by East Liberty at Negley Avenue. Like many parts of Pittsburgh , Garfield is a fairly steep neighborhood, with north-south residential streets running at about a 20 incline from Penn Avenue at the bottom to Mossfield Street at the top. Garfield is divided into the valley and the hilltop. Garfield is part of District 9 on the Pittsburgh City Council, and is currently represented by Rev. Ricky Burgess. The Garfield neighborhood has 13 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Garfield, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and the Penn Avenue business corridor and provide an easy way to access the Fort Pitt Playground and neighborhood parklets.

Like nearby Bloomfield and Friendship , the land comprising modern-day Garfield was acquired by Casper Taub from the local Delaware tribe . Taub sold it to his son-in-law, Joseph Conrad Winebiddle, in the late 18th century. About a hundred years later, Winebiddle's descendants broke the family estate into lots and sold them to new residents of an expanding City of Pittsburgh . The first owner of a lot in present-day Garfield bought his plot in 1881, on the day that U.S. President James Garfield was buried, so the neighborhood was named for the late President. Garfield's earliest settlers were predominantly blue-collar Irish laborers and their families, who worked in the mills and foundries down along the Allegheny River, shopped in local stores on Penn Avenue, and built and lived in modest brick foursquare homes on the streets running up from Penn Avenue. The community, then almost exclusively Catholic, built St. Lawrence O'Toole Parish on Penn Avenue in 1897. From 1880 until about 1960, the neighborhood remained as it began: a solid, working-class area. Neighborhood activist Aggie Brose described Garfield in 1960 as a place where You sponsored each other's kids, you went to all the weddings and funerals, you never wanted for a baby-sitter, you never had to call a repairman, you didn't need for a social. When you put the kids to bed, the women went out on the stoops. Things changed in the 1960s, when some Garfield residents began to leave the City for nearby suburbs in Shaler and Penn Hills. In response, the City's Urban Redevelopment Authority URA used eminent domain and attempted to change nearby East Liberty from an urban shopping area, then the third-busiest retail center in Pennsylvania, to a suburban one. The URA knocked down many small shops, accessible on foot or by bus, and thereby opened land for larger ones, accessible by car. At the same time, the City's housing authority built several massive public housing complexes on Garfield's borders: Garfield Heights, a 600 unit complex high up on Fern Street, and the East Mall, a 20 story tower straddling Penn Avenue at the entrance to East Liberty. These changes, designed to halt the slow trickle of Garfield residents to the suburbs, instead turned a trickle into a torrent. East Liberty lost most of its businesses, and the new housing projects, inhabited by poor African-Americans, unnerved Garfield residents. In 1969 the federal government gave the City funds to enforce housing codes in Garfield so that as old residents fled, their homes were not allowed to deteriorate. This move also backfired: long-time residents, told that homes built in 1900 and often passed through families over the years did not meet codes written in 1960, moved away rather than pay for upgrades. Thus began a textbook case of white flight : in 1970, Garfield had a population of roughly 10,000 people, 80 of them white. In 2000, Garfield's population had been cut almost in half to 5,450 people, 83 of them black. To halt what they perceived as the neighborhood's decline, in 1975 parishioners at St. Lawrence O'Toole founded the Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation BGC, a Community Development Corporation that uses private and government funds and activism to encourage home ownership and business development. Over the years, the organization has built or renovated dozens of housing units, and renovated commercial properties for dozens of small businesses, from restaurants to art galleries to theater companies. In the 1980s, a similar group called the Garfield Jubilee Association formed, with a goal of creating affordable housing. In recent years, the two groups have joined together in a joint project to build dozens of new single-family homes. In 2000, the BGC and Friendship Development Associates, Inc. formed the Penn Avenue Arts Initiative. The PAAI encourages artists to live and work along the Avenue by rehabbing properties, making small loans or grants for facade renovations, and organizing joint marketing events such as Unblurred, held the first Friday of each month, where the venues of Garfield and Friendship open for special events. Efforts by groups like these, along with a recent recognition that massive, 1960s-style social welfare projects often had negative consequences, have helped to revitalize the neighborhood. Commercially, Penn Avenue is recovering from the flight of local businesses in the 1970s and 1980s. Some bastions of the old neighborhood remain, as groups like the BGC and GJA, and FDA have worked to keep some banks and stores along Penn Avenue. Since 1990, these have been joined by newcomers: African-American barbershops and salons, tiny family-owned Vietnamese restaurants, and a series of arts-related businesses e.g., theatres, galleries, an architecture studio, a glass factory, a coffeeshop, and much more attracted by the PAAI. There has also been some positive residential development: the East Mall and Garfield Heights Senior highrise was razed in 2005, and the townhouse units are scheduled to be demolished in 2007 2008, and replaced with mixed-income units, as well as new replacement homes scattered through the neighborhood. Visitors to Garfield today will see a neighborhood on the rise, a formerly blighted community that is now becoming a vibrant community, with a focus on the arts, while not forgetting its roots 1 .

Its zip code is 15212, and it has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by both council members for District 6 Downtown, North Shore and District 1 Northside. In 1783, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania established a 3000-acre tract of land north of where the Allegheny River merged with the Ohio River . John Redick created an initial town plan for Allegheny City - which featured 36 city blocks surrounded by a common grazing area - the following year. That initial 36-block area is today's Allegheny Center. It is still surrounded on three sides by the former grazing area, now a public park called Allegheny Commons . On either side of this park are the neighborhoods of Allegheny West and East Allegheny . Because Allegheny City was intended by the Pennsylvania Legislature to serve as the county seat of Allegheny County , the central blocks of Redick's 36-block plan were designed for public uses, including a market house and post office. The main thoroughfare was East Ohio Street, which stretched from Allegheny West through Allegheny Center and then to Allegheny East and beyond. From the 19th century to 1907, Allegheny Center was thus the hub of downtown Allegheny City . The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh consisting of the old Allegheny Post Office and Buhl Planetarium joined by a 2006 addition is located within it, as is the old Carnegie Free Library of Allegheny now the New Hazlett Theater and the Children's MuseumLab. Allegheny Center is also home to the National Aviary , situated within West Park . After 1907 when Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City , this area continued to be a hub for those residents of what was now Pittsburgh's North Side . But the area deteriorated as: 1 Allegheny's wealthiest residents, who had founded Allegheny Country Club in 1895, moved the club to Sewickley in 1902 and began moving their residences along with it 2 the Great Depression caused an economic slowdown and 3 rationing during World War II prevented much investment in the buildings. As one example of the trend, the landmark Boggs Buhl department store, which had done a thriving business among Allegheny City's wealthy residents, steadily lost money after 1931 and was closed in 1958. In the 1950s, community leaders discussed how to revitalize the historic hub of Allegheny City and established a modern plan for Allegheny Center. Designed by architects Deeter Ritchey, it involved a 65 million project by Alcoa Properties, Inc. The construction project razed about 518 buildings including the Boggs Buhl department store - many of them taken by eminent domain - to make way for 2 professional buildings, 4 apartment complexes totaling 840 units, 50 townhouses, a shopping mall, and a 3-acre 12,000 m public square. The public square was the object of an international design competition sponsored by the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority . The entire Allegheny Redevelopment Area encompasses approximately 79 acres 320,000 m on the North Side, about a half-mile from downtown Pittsburgh. The project converted what had been an open, walkable business district into an enclosed mall called Allegheny Center Mall that had few pedestrian entrances and sat above an underground parking garage. The central portion of East Ohio Street was closed, and drivers were forced to take a new ring road around the mall and the other blocks of Redick's initial plan to proceed east or west. The former Allegheny Center Mall from PNC Park in 2014. The mall, opened in 1965 and anchored by Sears , F. W. Woolworth Company , and Zayre , had some initial success, but it did not revive the business fortunes of Allegheny City, which continued to decline after Interstate 279 allowed area residents to drive to the northern suburbs to shop. The mall's stores began closing in the 1990s, and the mall gradually became a successful office complex. Today, the 36-block area initially planned by John Redick consists of the Allegheny Center Mall - now Nova Place, which contains 1.5 million square feet of Class A office space in the old mall concourse, plus two of the office towers, restaurants, including Federal Galley, a fitness center, and Alloy 26, Pittsburgh's largest coworking space, which is located in the concourse - and several public structures including the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh . A former business district along North Avenue in Central Northside , which deteriorated along with Allegheny Center, is also being revived.

In December 1972, Clemente died in the crash of a plane he had chartered to take emergency relief goods for the survivors of a massive earthquake in Nicaragua . After his sudden death, the National Baseball Hall of Fame changed its rules so that a player who had been dead for at least six months would be eligible for entry. In 1973, Clemente was posthumously inducted, becoming the first player from the Caribbean and Latin America to be honored in the Hall of Fame. Born in Carolina, Puerto Rico , Clemente was a track and field star and an Olympic hopeful in his youth before deciding to turn his full attention to baseball. His professional career began at the age of eighteen, with the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League . He quickly attracted the attention of the Brooklyn Dodgers who signed him to a bonus of 10,000. However, due to the bonus rule under which Clemente had signed and the Dodgers decision to send him to the minor leagues, they lost Clemente to the Pittsburgh Pirates who drafted him after the 1954 season. Clemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He was the National League NL Most Valuable Player MVP in 1966, the NL batting leader in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a Gold Glove Award winner for 12 consecutive seasons from 1961 through 1972. His batting average was over .300 for 13 seasons and he had 3,000 hits during his major league career. He also was a two-time World Series champion . Clemente was the first player from the Caribbean and Latin America to win a World Series as a starting position player 1960, to receive an NL MVP Award 1966, and to receive a World Series MVP Award 1971. During the offseason, in addition to playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, Clemente was involved in charity work in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In 1972, he died in a plane crash at the age of 38 while en route to deliver aid to victims of the Nicaragua earthquake . The following season, the Pittsburgh Pirates retired his uniform number 21. In his honor, Major League baseball renamed the Commissioner's Award, given to the player who best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team, to the Roberto Clemente Award . Clemente was born on August 18, 1934, in Barrio San Ant n in Carolina, Puerto Rico , to Luisa Walker and Melchor Clemente. He was the youngest of seven siblings three were from his mother's previous marriage. During Clemente's childhood, his father worked as a foreman for sugar cane crops located in the municipality in the northeastern part of the island. Because the family's resources were limited, Clemente and his brothers worked alongside his father in the fields, loading and unloading trucks. Clemente had first shown interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios . When he was fourteen, he was recruited by Roberto Mar n to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after he was seen playing baseball in barrio San Ant n. He was with the team two years as a shortstop . He attended Julio Vizcarrondo High School in Carolina where he was a track and field star, participating in the high jump and javelin throw. Clemente was considered good enough to represent Puerto Rico at the Olympics . He later stated that throwing the javelin helped in strengthening his arm and with his footwork and release. Despite his all-around athletic skill, however, Clemente decided to focus on baseball and went on to join Puerto Rico's amateur league, playing for the Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of Juncos . Clemente's professional career began at age 18 when he accepted a contract from Pedr n Zorilla with Cangrejeros de Santurce Crabbers, a winter league team and franchise of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League LBPPR. Clemente signed with the team on October 9, 1952. He was a bench player during his first season but was promoted to the Cangrejeros' starting lineup the following season. During this season he hit .288 as the team's leadoff hitter. While Clemente was playing in the Puerto Rican League, the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract of 15,000 10,000 bonus and 5000 league minimum salary. Clemente signed with them on February 19, 1954. At the time of Clemente's signing, the bonus rule implemented by Major League Baseball was still in effect. The rule stipulated that when a major league team signed a player to a contract with a signing bonus in excess of 4,000 55,000 today, the team was required to keep that player on their 25-man active roster for two full seasons and failure to comply with the rule would result in the team losing the rights to that player's contract, and the player would then be exposed to the waiver wire. As Clemente's bonus was larger than 4,000, he was considered a bonus baby. However, the Dodgers decided against benching him for two years in the majors and decided to place him with the Montreal Royals , their International League Triple-A affiliate. While it is often believed that the Dodgers instructed manager Max Macon to use Clemente sparingly to prevent him from being drafted under the Rule 5 Draft , Macon himself denied it. Box scores also suggest that Macon platooned Clemente the same as he did with other outfielders. Affected early on by both climate and language differences, Clemente received assistance from bilingual teammates such as infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black . Black was the original target of the Pittsburgh Pirates ' scouting trip to Richmond on June 1, 1954. Noticing Clemente in batting practice, Pirates scout Clyde Sukeforth made inquiries and soon learned about Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby . Twelve years later, manager Macon acknowledged that we tried to sneak him through the draft, but it didn't work but denied being instructed to not play Clemente, stating that the player needed time to develop and was struggling against Triple-A pitching. However, Pittsburgh noticed his raw talents as Sukeforth recalled years later, I knew then he'd be our first draft choice. I told Montreal manager Max Macon to take good care of 'our boy' and see that he didn't get hurt. In 87 games with the Royals, Clemente hit .257 with two home runs. The first home run of his North American baseball career came on July 25, 1954 Clemente's extra inning , walk-off home run was hit in his first at-bat after entering the game as a defensive replacement . His only other minor league home run came on September 5. On his 20th birthday, August 8, he made a notable game-ending outfield assist , cutting down the potential tying run at the plate. At the end of the season, Clemente returned to play for Santurce where one of his teammates was Willie Mays . While with the team, the Pirates made Clemente the first selection of the Rule 5 draft that took place on November 22, 1954. For all but the first seven weeks of his major league career, Clemente wore number 21, so chosen because his full name of Roberto Clemente Walker had that many letters. For his first few weeks, Clemente wore the number 13, as his teammate Earl Smith was wearing number 21. It was later reassigned to Clemente. During the off-seasons except the 1958 59, 1962 63, 1965 66, 1968 69, 1971 72, and 1972 73 seasons, Clemente played professionally for the Cangrejeros de Santurce , Criollos de Caguas , and Senadores de San Juan in the Liga de B isbol Profesional de Puerto Rico , where he was considered a star. He sometimes managed the San Juan team. Clemente in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve in September 1958. In September 1958, Clemente joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve . He served his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island , South Carolina , Camp LeJeune in North Carolina , and Washington, D.C. At Parris Island, Clemente received recruit training with Platoon 346 of the 3rd Recruit Battalion. The rigorous Marine Corps training programs helped Clemente physically he added strength by gaining ten pounds and said his back troubles, caused by being in a 1954 auto accident, disappeared as a result of the training. He was a private first class in the Marine Corps Reserve until September 1964. The Pirates struggled through several difficult seasons through the 1950s. They did have a winning season in 1958, their first since 1948. Clemente debuted with the Pirates on April 17, 1955, wearing uniform number 13, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers . Early in his career with the Pirates, he was frustrated by racial and ethnic tensions, with sniping by the local media and some teammates. Clemente responded to this by saying I don't believe in color. He said that, during his upbringing, he was taught never to discriminate against someone based on ethnicity. Clemente was at a double disadvantage, as he was a Latin American and Caribbean player whose first language was Spanish and was of partially African descent. The year before, the Pirates had hired Curt Roberts , their first African-American player. They were the fifth team in the NL and ninth in the major leagues to do so, seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line by joining the Dodgers. When Clemente arrived in Pittsburgh, Roberts befriended him and helped him adjust to life in the major league, as well as in the Pittsburgh area. During his rookie season, Clemente had to sit out several games, as he had suffered a lower back injury in Puerto Rico the previous winter. A speeding, drunk driver rammed into his car at an intersection. He finished his rookie season with a .255 batting average, despite trouble hitting certain types of pitches. His defensive skills were highlighted during this season. Clemente in 1957 The following season, on July 25, 1956, at Forbes Field , Clemente erased a three-run, ninth-inning deficit with a bases-clearing inside-the-park home run , thus becoming the first and, as yet, only player in modern Major League history since 1900 to hit a documented walk-off, inside-the-park grand slam . Pittsburgh-based sportswriter John Steigerwald said that it may have been done only once in the history of baseball. Clemente was still fulfilling his Marine Corps Reserve duty during spring of 1959 and set to be released from Camp Lejeune until April 4. A Pennsylvania state senator, John M. Walker , wrote to US Senator Hugh Scott requesting an early release on March 4 so Clemente could join the team for spring training. Early in the 1960 season, Clemente led the league with a .353 batting average, and the 14 extra-base hits and 25 RBIs recorded in May alone resulted in Clemente's selection as the National League 's Player of the Month . His batting average would remain above the .300 mark throughout the course of the campaign. On August 5 at Forbes Field , Clemente crashed into the right-field wall while making a pivotal play, depriving San Francisco 's Willie Mays of a leadoff , extra-base hit in a game eventually won by Pittsburgh, 1 0. The resulting injury necessitated five stitches to the chin and a five-game layoff for Clemente, while the catch itself was described by Giants beat writer Bob Stevens as ranking with the greatest of all time, as well as one of the most frightening to watch and painful to make. The Pirates compiled a 95 59 record during the regular season, winning the NL pennant, and defeated the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series . Clemente batted .310 in the series, hitting safely at least once in every game. His .314 batting average, 16 home runs, and defensive playing during the course of the season had earned him his first spot on the NL All-Star roster as a reserve player, and he replaced Hank Aaron in right field during the 7th and 8th innings in the second All-Star game held that season two All-Star games were held each season from 1959 through 1962. During spring training in 1961, following advice from Pirates' batting coach George Sisler , Clemente tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat to slow the speed of his swing. During the 1961 season, Clemente was named the starting NL right fielder for the first of two All-Star games and went 2 for 4 he hit a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team's first run, then drove in the second with a sacrifice fly . With the AL ahead 4 3 in the 10th inning, he teamed with fellow future HOFers Hank Aaron , Willie Mays , and Frank Robinson to engineer a come-from-behind 5 4 NL victory, culminating in Clemente's walk-off single off knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm . Clemente started again in right field for the second All-Star game held that season and was 0 for 2, flying and grounding out in the 2nd and 4th innings. That season he received his first Gold Glove Award . Following the 1961 season, he traveled to Puerto Rico along with Orlando Cepeda , who was a native of Ponce . When both players arrived, they were received by 18,000 people. During this time, he was also involved in managing the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rican League, as well as playing with the team during the major league off-season. During the course of the winter league, Clemente injured his thigh while doing some work at home but wanted to participate in the league's all-star game. He pinch-hit in the game and got a single, but experienced a complication of his injury as a result, and had to undergo surgery shortly after being carried off the playing field. This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the 1965 season, during which he batted .257. Although he was inactive for many games, when he returned to the regular starting lineup, he got hits in 33 out of 34 games and his batting average climbed up to .340. He participated as a pinch hitter and replaced Willie Stargell playing left field during the All-Star Game on July 15. Clemente in 1966 Clemente was an All-Star every season he played in the 1960s other than 1968 the only year in his career after 1959 in which he failed to hit above .300 and a Gold Glove winner for each of his final 12 seasons, beginning in 1961. He won the NL batting title four times: 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and won the league's MVP Award in 1966, hitting .317 with a career-high 29 home runs and 119 RBIs. In 1967, Clemente registered a career-high .357 batting average, hit 23 home runs, and batted in 110 runs. Following that season, in an informal poll conducted by Sport Magazine at baseball's Winter Meetings , a plurality of major league GMs declared Clemente the best player in baseball today, edging out AL Triple Crown winner Carl Yastrzemski by a margin of 8 to 6, with one vote each going to Hank Aaron , Bob Gibson , Bill Freehan and Ron Santo . In an effort to make him seem more American, sportswriters started calling him Bob or Bobby. His baseball cards even listed him as Bob Clemente, a practice that persisted through to 1969. He disliked the practice, which he felt was disrespectful to his Puerto Rican and Latino heritage. Clemente would correct reporters who referred to him as Bob during post-game interviews, but the issue continued throughout the 1960s. The 1970 season was the last one that the Pirates played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was an emotional situation. The Pirates' final game at Forbes Field occurred on June 28, 1970. That day, Clemente said that it was hard to play in a different field, saying, I spent half my life there. The night of July 24, 1970, was declared Roberto Clemente Night on this day, several Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium and cheered Clemente while wearing traditional Puerto Rican attire. A ceremony to honor Clemente took place, during which he received a scroll with 300,000 signatures compiled in Puerto Rico, and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity work following Clemente's request. During the 1970 season, Clemente compiled a .352 batting average the Pirates won the NL East pennant but were subsequently eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds . During the offseason, Roberto Clemente experienced some tense situations while he was working as manager of the Senadores and when his father, Melchor Clemente, experienced medical problems and underwent surgery. In the 1971 season, the Pirates won the NL East, defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games to win the NL pennant, and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series . Baltimore had won 101 games third season in row with 100 wins and swept the American League Championship Series , both for the third consecutive year, and were the defending World Series champions. The Orioles won the first two games in the series, but Pittsburgh won the championship in seven games. This marked the second occasion that Clemente helped win a World Series for the Pirates. Over the course of the series, Clemente had a .414 batting average 12 hits in 29 at-bats , performed well defensively, and hit a solo home run in the deciding 2 1 seventh game victory. Following the conclusion of the season, he received the World Series Most Valuable Player Award . Although he was frustrated and struggling with injuries, Clemente played in 102 games and hit .312 during the 1972 season . He also made the annual NL All-Star roster for the fifteenth 15th time he played in 1415 All-Star games and won his twelfth consecutive Gold Glove. On September 30, he hit a double in the fourth inning off Jon Matlack of the New York Mets at Three Rivers Stadium for his 3,000th. It was his last regular season at-bat of his career. By playing in right field in one more regular season game, on October 3, Clemente tied Honus Wagner 's record for games played as a Pittsburgh Pirate, with 2,433 games played. In the NL playoffs that season, he batted .235 as he went 4 for 17. His last game was October 11, 1972, at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium in the fifth and final game of the 1972 NLCS , won by the Reds in the bottom of the 9th inning. Clemente had his final hit single in the 1st inning his final plate appearance was an intentional walk in the 8th inning. He and Bill Mazeroski were the last Pirate players remaining from the 1960 World Series championship team. Clemente spent much of his time during the off-season involved in charity work. He also visited Managua , the capital city of Nicaragua , in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series . When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors. The airplane which he chartered for the New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane , had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot, and it was also overloaded by 4,200 pounds 1,900 kg. It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure. A search and rescue effort was immediately launched, led by the USCGC Sagebrush . A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case which apparently belonged to Clemente was the only personal item of his which was recovered from the plane. Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguill n was the only member of the Pirates who did not attend Roberto's memorial service. Instead, the Pirates catcher chose to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane were never recovered. Montreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker , then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico, had helped him load the plane. Because Clemente wanted Walker, who was single, to go and enjoy New Year's Eve, Clemente told him not to join him on the flight. A few hours later, Walker returned to his condo and discovered that the plane carrying Clemente had crashed. In an interview for the ESPN documentary series SportsCentury in 2002, Clemente's widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had told her that he thought he was going to die young several times. Indeed, while he was being asked when he would get his 3,000th career hit by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities, Clemente's response was Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, like I said before, you never know because God tells you how long you're going to be here. So you never know what can happen tomorrow. At the time of his death, Clemente had established several records with the Pirates, including most triples in a single game three and hits in two consecutive games ten. He won 12 Gold Glove Awards and shares the record of most won among outfielders with Willie Mays . Clemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He won the NL MVP Award in 1966, and was named NL Player of the Month Award three times May 1960, May 1967, July 1969. Clemente led the Pirates to two World Series titles, being named World Series MVP in 1971. Clemente had two three-home run games in his career, as well as eight five-hit games in MLB. Roberto Clemente's number 21 was retired by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1973. On March 20, 1973, the Baseball Writers' Association of America held a special election for the Baseball Hall of Fame . They voted to waive the waiting period for Clemente, due to the circumstances of his death, and posthumously elected him for induction into the Hall of Fame, giving him 393 out of 424 available votes, for 92.7 of the votes. Clemente's number 21 was retired by the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 6, 1973, a few months after his election to the Hall of Fame. There have been calls for MLB to retire number 21 league-wide, as was done with Jackie Robinson 's number 42 in 1997, but the sentiment has been opposed by the Robinson family. In 1999, Clemente was ranked number 20 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking Latin American and Caribbean player on the list. Later that year, he was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team . In 2020, The Athletic ranked Clemente at number 40 on its Baseball 100 list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski . In 2007, Clemente was selected for the All Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team for the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Gold Glove Award . He was named to Major League Baseball's Latino Legends Team in 2005. In 1973, Major League Baseball renamed the Commissioner's Award to the Roberto Clemente Award . It has been awarded every year to a player with outstanding baseball playing skills who is personally involved in community work. A trophy and a donation check for a charity of the player's choice are presented annually at the World Series . Clemente was elected to the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010, and the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2003, he was also inducted into the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame. Near the old Forbes Field where Clemente began his major league career, the city of Pittsburgh renamed a street in his honor. Additionally, the city named Roberto Clemente Memorial Park in his honor. At Pirate City , the Pirates spring training home in Bradenton, Florida , a section of 27th Street East is named Roberto Clemente Memorial Highway. The United States Postal Service issued a Roberto Clemente postal stamp on August 17, 1984. The stamp was designed by Juan Lopez-Bonilla and shows Clemente wearing a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cap with a Puerto Rican flag in the background. A statue of Clemente outside of PNC Park in Pittsburgh. The Pirates originally erected a statue in memory of Clemente at Three Rivers Stadium , just before the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game . It has since been moved to PNC Park when it opened in 2001, and stands outside the park's centerfield gates. In 1974, the Harlem River State Park in Morris Heights , The Bronx, New York City , was renamed Roberto Clemente State Park in his honor. In 2013, forty years after his election to the Hall of Fame, a statue was unveiled at the park. It was the first statue honoring a Puerto Rican to be unveiled in New York City . In 2012, the Puerto Rico Professional Baseball League LBPPR was renamed Liga de B isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente, the number 21 was also permanently retired. A number of schools have been named after Clemente, including the Roberto Clemente Community Academy in Chicago , and the Roberto Clemente Charter School in Allentown, Pennsylvania . In 2002, 30 years after his death, Major League Baseball proclaimed September 15 as Roberto Clemente Day. In 1973, President Richard Nixon posthumously honored Clemente with the Presidential Citizens Medal . That same day, Congress honored Clemente with the Congressional Gold Medal . In 2003, President George W. Bush awarded Clemente the Presidential Medal of Freedom . Clemente is an iconic sports figure in Puerto Rico , widely revered by his people. In 2022, the government of Puerto Rico granted Clemente the formal recognition of pr cer national hero. The Coliseo Roberto Clemente , opened in 1973 in San Juan , and Estadio Roberto Clemente , opened in 2000 in Carolina , are both named in his honor. Clemente was married on November 14, 1964 to Vera Zabala at San Fernando Church in Carolina . The couple had three children: Roberto often referred to as Roberto Jr., born in 1965 Luis Roberto, born in 1966 and Roberto Enrique, born in 1969. Vera Clemente died on November 16, 2019, aged 78. Clemente was a devout Catholic . In the 2010s, there was an initiative to have him canonized by the Catholic Church.

A medication is a drug used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease. The Apothecary or The Chemist by Gabri l Metsu c. 1651 67 Pharmacy is the science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing and monitoring medications , aiming to ensure the safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines . It is a miscellaneous science as it links health sciences with pharmaceutical sciences and natural sciences . The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on the setting, pharmacy practice is either classified as community or institutional pharmacy. Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies is considered clinical pharmacy . The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications. It also includes more modern services related to health care including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information with patient counselling. Pharmacists , therefore, are experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients. An establishment in which pharmacy in the first sense is practiced is called a pharmacy this term is more common in the United States or chemists which is more common in Great Britain, though pharmacy is also used. In the United States and Canada, drugstores commonly sell medicines, as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery , cosmetics , office supplies , toys , hair care products and magazines , and occasionally refreshments and groceries. In its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the apothecary may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology , prior to the formulation of the scientific method . Pharmacy, Tacuinum sanitatis casanatensis 14th century The field of pharmacy can generally be divided into various disciplines: Pharmaceutics and Computational Pharmaceutics Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy Pharmacology Pharmacy Practice Pharmacoinformatics Pharmacogenomics The boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut. Often, collaborative teams from various disciplines pharmacists and other scientists work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology. Pharmacology is sometimes considered the fourth discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy patient-oriented and pharmacology a biomedical science requiring the scientific method receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline. Pharmacoinformatics is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety. Pharmacogenomics is the study of genetic-linked variants that effect patient clinical responses, allergies, and metabolism of drugs. The World Health Organization estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide. Pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialized education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines. Pharmacists may also be small business proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimization of drug treatment for an individual. Pharmacists are represented internationally by the International Pharmaceutical Federation FIP, an NGO linked with World Health Organization WHO. They are represented at the national level by professional organisations such as the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in the UK, Pharmaceutical Society of Australia PSA, Canadian Pharmacists Association CPhA, Indian Pharmacist Association IPA, Pakistan Pharmacists Association PPA, American Pharmacists Association APhA, and the Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society MPS. In some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and ethics of the profession. In the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the Board of Pharmacy Specialties include: cardiovascular, infectious disease , oncology , pharmacotherapy, nuclear, nutrition , and psychiatry . The Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied toxicology . A pharmacy worker distributing drugs to an old woman at a local clinic. Pharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies . In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council GPhC. The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises. In the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications. Some states have a legally mandated pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratio . Dispensing assistants are commonly referred to as dispensers and in community pharmacies perform largely the same tasks as a pharmacy technician. They work under the supervision of pharmacists and are involved in preparing dispensing and labelling medicines for provision to patients. In the UK, this group of staff can sell certain medicines including pharmacy only and general sales list medicines over the counter. They cannot prepare prescription-only medicines for supply to patients. Physician and Pharmacist, illustration from Medicinarius 1505 by Hieronymus Brunschwig The earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the Sushruta Samhita , an Indian Ayurvedic treatise attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC. However, the earliest text as preserved dates to the 3rd or 4th century AD. Many Sumerian 4th millennium BC early 2nd millennium BC cuneiform clay tablets record prescriptions for medicine. Ancient Egyptian pharmacological knowledge was recorded in various papyri such as the Ebers Papyrus of 1550 BC, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus of the 16th century BC. Dioscorides, De Materia Medica , Byzantium, 15th century In Ancient Greece , Diocles of Carystus 4th century BC was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants. He wrote several treatises on the topic. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five-volume book in his native Greek in the 1st century AD. The Latin translation De Materia Medica Concerning medical substances was used as a basis for many medieval texts and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age , themselves deriving their knowledge from earlier Greek Byzantine medicine Byzantine Medicine . Pharmacy in China dates at least to the earliest known Chinese manual, the Shennong Bencao Jing The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic , dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the Han dynasty and was attributed to the mythical Shennong . Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript Recipes for 52 Ailments, found in the Mawangdui , sealed in 168 BC. In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period 538 710 and the early Nara period 710 794, the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected. The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taih Code 701 and re-stated in the Y r Code 718. Ranked positions in the pre- Heian Imperial court were established and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration 1868. In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists and even pharmacist assistants were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor. There is a stone sign for a pharmacy shop with a tripod, a mortar, and a pestle opposite one for a doctor in the Arcadian Way in Ephesus near Kusadasi in Turkey. The current Ephesus dates back to 400 BC and was the site of the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the world. In Baghdad the first pharmacies, or drug stores, were established in 754, under the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age . By the 9th century, these pharmacies were state-regulated. The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology . Muhammad ibn Zakar ya R zi Rhazes 865 915, for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi Abulcasis 936 1013 pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation . His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the simples from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl d 869, was, however, the first physician to record his findings in a pharmacopoeia , describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni 973 1050 wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah The Book of Drugs , in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna , too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine . Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo , and Ibn al-Wafid 1008 1074, both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by ' Mesue ' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by ' Abenguefit '. Peter of Abano 1250 1316 translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris . Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies , amongst others describing arsenious oxide , and being acquainted with silicic acid . He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate , and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol , and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking. In Europe , pharmacy-like shops began to appear during the 12th century. In 1240, emperor Frederic II issued a decree by which the physician's and the apothecary's professions were separated. L wen-Apotheke in Trier , operating continuously from at least 1241 Sign of the Town Hall Pharmacy in Tallinn , operating continuously from at least 1422, showing the Bowl of Hygieia There are pharmacies in Europe that have been in operation since medieval times. In Florence , Italy, the director of the museum in the former Santa Maria Novella pharmacy says that the pharmacy there dates back to 1221. In Trier Germany, the L wen-Apotheke is in operation since 1241, the oldest pharmacy in Europe in continuous operation. In Dubrovnik Croatia, a pharmacy that first opened in 1317 is located inside the Franciscan monastery: it is the 2nd oldest pharmacy in Europe that is still operating. In the Town Hall Square of Tallinn Estonia, there is a pharmacy dating from at least 1422. The medieval Esteve Pharmacy , located in Ll via , a Catalan enclave close to Puigcerd , is a museum: the building dates back to the 15th century and the museum keeps albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs. Pharmacists practice in a variety of areas including community pharmacies, infusion pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, medical communication companies, research facilities, pharmaceutical companies, extended care facilities, psychiatric hospitals, and regulatory agencies. Pharmacists themselves may have expertise in a medical specialty . A pharmacy in Klaukkala , Finland A pharmacy also known as a chemist in Australia , New Zealand and the British Isles or drugstore in North America retail pharmacy in industry terminology or apothecary , historically is where most pharmacists practice the profession of pharmacy. It is the community pharmacy in which the dichotomy of the profession exists health professionals who are also retailers. Community pharmacies usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary, where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by Muslim pharmacists in Baghdad in 754 AD. Pharmacies within hospitals differ considerably from community pharmacies. Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues, and pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues. Because of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications i.e., drug interactions and patient compliance issues in the hospital and at home, many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency, sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy. For example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematologyoncology, HIVAIDS, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine , toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, herbal medicine , neurologyepilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more. Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine. Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition TPN, and other medications are given intravenously. That is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities. Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high-risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology and the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety require hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible. Pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimize the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention. Clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings, but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics . Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care. They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection. In the UK clinical pharmacists can also prescribe some medications for patients on the NHS or privately, after completing a non-medical prescribers course to become an Independent Prescriber. The clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of drug therapy e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy and its efficacy. Research shows that pharmacist led strategies reduce errors related to medication use. The pharmacist must also consider potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and patient drug allergies while they design and initiate a drug therapy plan. Since the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in-office visits to manage chronic disease states. In the U.S. federal health care system including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states, such North Carolina and New Mexico , these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority. In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification. The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP. Compounding involves preparing drugs in forms that are different from the generic prescription standard. This may include altering the strength, ingredients, or dosage form. Compounding is a way to create custom drugs for patients who may not be able to take the medication in its standard form, such as due to an allergy or difficulty swallowing. Compounding is necessary for these patients to still be able to properly get the prescriptions they need. One area of compounding is preparing drugs in new dosage forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated lollipop that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead. Another form of compounding is by mixing different strengths g, mg, mcg of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the physician , physician assistant , nurse practitioner , or clinical pharmacist practitioner . This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy. Compounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies. Consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review i.e. cognitive services than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes , but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings. Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for a large pharmacy management company such as Omnicare , Kindred Healthcare or PharMerica . This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists andor provide consulting services. The main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990. Veterinary pharmacies, sometimes called animal pharmacies , may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals. Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on veterinary medicine , are often very different from those related to people, in some jurisdictions veterinary pharmacy may be kept separate from regular pharmacies. Nuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients.

Military pharmacy is a different working environment to civilian practise because military pharmacy technicians perform duties such as evaluating medication orders, preparing medication orders, and dispensing medications. This would be illegal in civilian pharmacies because these duties are required to be performed by a licensed registered pharmacist. In the US military, state laws that prevent technicians from counseling patients or doing the final medication check prior to dispensing to patients rather than a pharmacist solely responsible for these duties do not apply. Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science. Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies. As a practice area and specialist domain, pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals. Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment, and optimization. Specialty pharmacies supply high-cost injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled, specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed. In addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs. In the US, it is currently the fastest-growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs. Due to the demand for clinicians who can properly manage these specific patient populations, the Specialty Pharmacy Certification Board has developed a new certification exam to certify specialty pharmacists. Along with the 100 questions computerized multiple-choice exam, pharmacists must also complete 3,000 hours of specialty pharmacy practice within the past three years as well as 30 hours of specialty pharmacist continuing education within the past two years. The pharmaceutical sciences are a group of interdisciplinary areas of study concerned with the design , manufacturing , action , delivery , and classification of drugs . They apply knowledge from chemistry inorganic , physical , biochemical and analytical , biology anatomy , physiology , biochemistry , cell biology , and molecular biology , epidemiology , statistics , chemometrics , mathematics , physics , and chemical engineering . The pharmaceutical sciences are further subdivided into several specific specialties , with four main branches: Pharmacology : the study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on human beings . Pharmacodynamics : the study of the cellular and molecular interactions of drugs with their receptors . Simply What the drug does to the body Pharmacokinetics : the study of the factors that control the concentration of drug at various sites in the body. Simply What the body does to the drug Pharmaceutical toxicology : the study of the harmful or toxic effects of drugs. Pharmacogenomics : the study of the inheritance of characteristic patterns of interaction between drugs and organisms. Pharmaceutical chemistry : the study of drug design to optimize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and synthesis of new drug molecules Medicinal Chemistry . Pharmaceutics : the study and design of drug formulation for optimum delivery , stability , pharmacokinetics, and patient acceptance . Pharmacognosy : the study of medicines derived from natural sources. As new discoveries advance and extend the pharmaceutical sciences, subspecialties continue to be added to this list. Importantly, as knowledge advances, boundaries between these specialty areas of pharmaceutical sciences are beginning to blur. Many fundamental concepts are common to all pharmaceutical sciences. These shared fundamental concepts further the understanding of their applicability to all aspects of pharmaceutical research and drug therapy . Pharmacocybernetics also known as pharma-cybernetics, cybernetic pharmacy, and cyber pharmacy is an emerging field that describes the science of supporting drugs and medications use through the application and evaluation of informatics and internet technologies, so as to improve the pharmaceutical care of patients. The word pharmacy is derived from Old French farmacie substance, such as a food or in the form of a medicine which has a laxative effect from Medieval Latin pharmacia from Greek pharmakeia Greek : a medicine, which itself derives from pharmakon , meaning drug, poison , spell which is etymologically related to pharmakos . Separation of prescribing and dispensing, also called dispensing separation, is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a medical prescription is independent from the pharmacist who provides the prescription drug . In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs. In contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces conflict of interest in the healthcare industry , unnecessary health care , and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances. In 2022 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development proposed that pharmaceutical companies should be required to collect and destroy unused or expired medicines that they have put on the market in order to reduce public health risks around the misuse of medicines obtained from waste bins, the development of antimicrobial resistant bacteria from the discharge of antibiotics into environmental systems and economic losses from wasted healthcare resources. Potentially harmful concentrations of pharmaceutical waste has been detected in more than a quarter of water samples taken from 258 rivers around the world. OECD recommend that medicines should be collected separately from household waste and that marketplaces and redistribution platforms for unused close-to-expiry-date medicines should be set up. Such extended producer responsibility schemes are already running in France, Spain and Portugal. Pharmacists now go on rounds with doctors and have more patient interaction. In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system . Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills. In particular, Medication Therapy Management MTM includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients. Such services include a thorough analysis of all medication prescription , non-prescription, and herbals currently being taken by an individual. The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system. This shift has already commenced in some countries for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights as in Alberta and British Columbia or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews Medschecks in Ontario. In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education . They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews . In Scotland, the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy Pharm. D. degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists , who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes , are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of senior care pharmacy. In addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives. There is enough evidence to show that integrated pharmacy based initiatives significantly impact adherence for chronic patients. For example, a study published in NIH shows pharmacy based interventions improved patients' medication adherence rates by 2.1 percent and increased physicians' initiation rates by 38 percent, compared to the control group.

The commission cares for historical manuscripts, public records, and objects of historical interest museums archeology publications historic sites and properties historic preservation geographic names and the promotion of public interest in Pennsylvania history. PHMC was established on June 6, 1945, by state Act No. 446, merging the Pennsylvania Historical Commission PHC , The State Museum of Pennsylvania , and Pennsylvania State Archives . The PHMC administers the Historical Marker Program, which, when it began in 1914, installed metal plaques onto large rocks and boulders to commemorate individuals, events, and landmarks throughout the state. The Pennsylvania Historical Commission, the predecessor to the PHMC, launched the program. The markers were redesigned in 1945 46 to make them easier to read from a passing car. Large cast aluminum markers were mounted on poles along a street or road, close to where a landmark was located, a person lived or worked, or an event occurred. By 2020, more than 2,000 markers were in place and were being maintained by the PHMC. The PHMC has posted criteria for inclusion for new markers and accepts marker proposals from the public. PHMC also publishes Pennsylvania Heritage magazine in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Heritage Foundation .

The community was named after a tavern once located there. Like nearby Squirrel Hill , it contains a large Jewish population, but is still majority Catholic and contributes to a high percentage of students enrolled in Taylor Allderdice High School , Oakland Catholic High School , and Central Catholic High School . The most prominent feature of Point Breeze is Henry Clay Frick 's Clayton, which is a part of the 5.5-acre 2.2 ha Frick Art Historical Center . Nearby is St. Bede School, a Catholic school, and the Pittsburgh New Church School. It is also the home to two Pittsburgh Public Schools , Linden Academy elementary school and Sterrett Middle School , and the Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary . The neighborhood also hosts much open space, with Westinghouse Park , Mellon Park , the scenic Homewood Cemetery , as well as the northern edge of Frick Park within its borders. Pulitzer Prize winner Annie Dillard 's popular memoir , An American Childhood , is set in Point Breeze during the 1950s. As a child she attended Park Place Elementary . Both of John Edgar Wideman 's memoirs, Brothers and Keepers and Hoop Roots , use North Point Breeze's Westinghouse Park as a setting, as well as in his fictional Homewood Trilogy . Although officially distinct neighborhoods separated by Penn Avenue , Point Breeze is also frequently taken to include North Point Breeze . Point Breeze has six borders, five with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of North Point Breeze to the north, Regent Square to the southeast, Squirrel Hill South to the south and southwest, Squirrel Hill North to the west, and Shadyside to the northwest. The other border is with the borough of Wilkinsburg to the east. Point Breeze also runs catty-corner without a direct border with the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Larimer to the north at the intersection of Penn and Fifth Avenues This intersection also serves as an east west diagonal for the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Shadyside and North Point Breeze. The eastern edge of the neighborhood, north of Regent Square and east of Frick Park , comprises the neighborhood of Park Place . The Shady Side Academy Junior School sits here, as does Environmental Charter School , a Pittsburgh Public School that operates as a charter school in the building originally known as Park Place School .

It is bordered by Highland Park , Morningside , Stanton Heights , Garfield , Friendship , Shadyside and Larimer , and falls largely within Pittsburgh City Council District 9, with a few areas in District 8. One of the most notable features in the East Liberty skyline is the East Liberty Presbyterian Church , which is an area landmark. Around the time of the American Revolution , East Liberty was a free grazing area in Allegheny County located a few miles east of the young, growing town called Pittsburgh. In older English usage, a liberty was a plot of common land on the outskirts of a town. Two farming patriarchs owned much of the nearby land, and their descendants' names grace streets in and around East Liberty today. John Conrad Winebiddle owned land west of present-day East Liberty, in what are now Bloomfield , Garfield , and Friendship , and his daughter Barbara inherited a portion close to what is now East Liberty. Alexander Negley owned a farm called Fertile Bottom north of present-day East Liberty along the southern bank of the Allegheny River . Negley's land included some of present-day East Liberty and much of nearby Highland Park , Morningside , Larimer , and Stanton Heights . Alexander Negley's son Jacob married Barbara Winebiddle, built a manor house, and developed a village that he called East Liberty after the old grazing commons. In 1816, Negley saw to it that the Pittsburgh - Greensburg turnpike was built through East Liberty, which made the area a trading center and ensured its future growth. East Liberty truly began to develop as a commercial area in 1843, when Jacob's daughter Sarah Jane Negley married the ambitious lawyer Thomas Mellon . Mellon had first visited the area of modern-day East Liberty in 1823, when as a 10-year-old he saw the Negley mansion for the first time and decided he wanted something like it. He achieved this goal and much more: after first becoming a prosperous lawyer, he made his true fortune by marrying Sarah Jane Negley, selling or renting the land near East Liberty that she inherited, and using the proceeds to finance Pittsburgh's nascent industries. Like Jacob Negley before him, Thomas Mellon worked to make East Liberty a transportation hub: Mellon convinced some of Pittsburgh's first trolley lines to pass through East Liberty. East Liberty developed more or less independently of Pittsburgh until the Pennsylvania Railroad opened the East Liberty station in the 1850s. This passenger depot served to connect East Liberty to the city twenty-six trains transported people to and from downtown on a daily basis. The rail connection was of crucial importance for the area's future development, because Pittsburgh was just about to enter its industrial boom period that would last between the end of the Civil War and World War I. As the city's population swelled to fuel the burgeoning iron and steel industry, East Liberty grew too. The neighborhood's population increased from under 1,000 in 1850 to over 46,000 by 1910. East Liberty acted as a first-ring residential suburb for elite families looking to escape the industrial smoke and soot of the city. By the turn of the century, it was one of the richest suburbs in America, containing many of the wealthy industrialists mansions. However, East Liberty was not exclusively an elite, Anglo-American neighborhood. The East Liberty Station brought floods of European immigrants and African American migrants from the South, who were drawn by Pittsburgh's manufacturing and industrial jobs. The neighborhood became home to an impressive number of churches for various religions and ethnicities by the late nineteenth century. There were separate places of worship for German and Italian Protestants, Irish, Italian and German Catholics, as well as a Presbyterian church for Anglo-Americans and an AME church for African Americans. East Liberty's diverse mix of Italian, Anglo-American, German, African-American, Jewish, Polish, Greek, and Irish residents stayed intact until after World War II. On June 30, 1868, the City of Pittsburgh annexed Collins and Liberty townships, which together included East Liberty. Thanks to its favorable location and Mellon's guiding hand, East Liberty became a thriving commercial center in the following years. East Liberty's merchants served many of Pittsburgh's industrial millionaires, who settled in nearby Shadyside and Point Breeze . Professionals in Highland Park and Friendship and laborers in Bloomfield and Garfield also shopped in East Liberty. There were four movie theaters. Actor-singer Dick Powell got his start singing at the Enright Theater. By 1950, the area was a bustling and fully urban marketplace, anchored by Sears-Roebuck store on Highland Avenue and Albert J Mansmann's Department Store on Penn Avenue. It had become the largest, in terms of sales dollars, non-center-city business district in the country. East Liberty's decline was precipitated by a series of government policies relating to the underwriting of mortgages for homes commonly referred to as redlining . The residential areas immediately surrounding East Liberty's main business district consisted primarily of tightly packed wood frame homes built in the mid-to-late 1800s. . In 1937, The George F Cram Company undertook the creation of federally sponsored surveys and maps which ultimately became the 'redlined' maps used by banks for underwriting. The Cram Maps listed this housing stock as obsolete, noted the infiltration of Jews... and Negroes , and the large number of people on relief the New Deal version of Welfare as justification for redlining the area. The result of this redlining was two-fold first, it made accessing conventional forms of credit for home purchases and renovations difficult and second, it fostered segregation of low income minorities in a neighborhood that was clearly racially diverse in 1937. Because most real estate is purchased with a mortgage, and banks would not lend against properties in redlined areas, most prospective buyers could not buy homes in the area at competitive prices, causing an artificial collapse of demand and property value. Without capital to fund repairs and renovations, homes in poor repair deteriorated over time. Indeed, when urban renewal's blight remediation via demolition was undertaken in the 1960s, the areas redlined in 1937 were those designated as blighted, and razed. The residential neighborhoods north of the redlined areas were not immune to the impact of redlining. The larger brick four-square homes built in the first 20 years of the 20th Century were interspersed with the estates of Pittsburgh's wealthy. However, the George F. Cram surveys noted ...negro encroachment threatening, calling it an obsolete, ...mediocre section of East Liberty., and designated it as a higher risk for lenders. Though this area of the neighborhood declined in tandem with the greater East Liberty neighborhood, it was spared the greater destruction of Urban Renewal. Two decisions in the 1960s exacerbated the trends begun with redlining. The first was an attempt to halt a slow trickle of businesses from the City to the suburbs. In the early 1960s, a few of East Liberty's larger merchants saw that some residents of Pittsburgh's East End were moving to the suburbs, and that suburban shopping malls were consequently growing and expanding. These merchants feared that suburban development would harm East Liberty's status as a market center, and asked the City of Pittsburgh's Urban Redevelopment Authority URA to take action. The URA proposed creating an outdoor pedestrian mall on Penn Avenue, to be surrounded by car-friendly roads on which large stores, surrounded by parking lots, could serve shoppers just as the new suburban stores were doing. This plan required the demolition of roughly half of the 254 ac 103 ha that comprised East Liberty. As noted previously, the area targeted for demolition roughly aligned with those parts of the neighborhood redlined in 1937. After some contentious debate, the plan was approved, and the URA stopped traffic on the busiest part of Penn Avenue the old Greensburg-Pittsburgh turnpike of Jacob Negley's day and routed it onto a series of new, one-way thoroughfares called Penn Circle that formed a ring around the central business district. Many small shops were destroyed a million square feet of retail space in all. These demolitions destroyed the dense, walkable commercial district and replaced much of it with unattractive parking lots and vacant properties, hastening the decline of the businesses that remained. While the URA was remaking the street plan of East Liberty, the City of Pittsburgh's housing authority made a second set of changes to the neighborhood. Housing authority planners noted that the nearby African-American neighborhood of Homewood was overcrowded, largely as a result of the URA's earlier demolition of the lower Hill District to create the Civic Arena , which had forced many of the Hill's African-Americans out and into the North Side and Homewood . The housing authority's solution was to build three large housing complexes, each close to 20 stories tall, in East Liberty along the new Penn Circle roads. These two measures ultimately failed to preserve East Liberty as a market center, and arguably hastened the old neighborhood's demise. By routing cars away from Penn Avenue, the URA's new street plan seemed to send a message that the neighborhood's commercial center was not worth visiting. The housing authority's massive housing complexes quickly developed a reputation as centers for crime, and this reputation likely did as much as the confusing street plan to drive commerce away from East Liberty. Redlining had already driven away middle class homebuyers, and the public housing complexes were exclusively for low-income renters. This created population demographics that were severely poor and unable to support a healthy commercial sector. Urban renewal had devastating consequences for the neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959 but only 292 in 1970 and just 98 in 1979. The businesses that remained tended not to serve the majority of nearby Pittsburghers, but only the captive audience that remained in what was now an urban ghetto. Steep population decline followed urban renewal. East Liberty became a segregated neighborhood with high poverty rates, low rates of homeownership, and a legacy of disinvestment that continued well after the Community Reinvestment Act eliminated redlining. In the past 20 years, the population fell from 7,973 in 1990 to 6,871 in 2000, and 5,698 in 2016. The reason for this is both the lingering effects of urban renewal and redlining. A 2018 study of demographic changes in East Liberty suggests that abandonment due to poor property condition drove the bulk of population change in East Liberty. Evidence of previous widespread abandonment exists both in the form of vacant lots which once held homes and in the presence of new homes and apartments built on previously vacant lots. East Liberty business district along Penn Avenue. In the three decades following 1980, East Liberty has slowly regained its status as a market destination for shoppers. In 1979, Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh National Bank, local property owners and other businesses created a nonprofit community development corporation, East Liberty Development, Inc. ELDI. and hired an executive director, David Feehan. During the 1980s, a number of important developments occurred, spearheaded by ELDI, which acquired and renovated a vacant hotel now 100 Sheridan Square purchased the block that included the Regent Theater and Penn Highland Building and worked with developers to bring the first market rate condo to the community and a new shopping center called East Liberty Station on Penn Avenue, east of Penn Circle. During the 1980s, the collection of small shops on Penn Circle South expanded, more than 200 businesses located in East Liberty, and more than 80 million was invested in real estate development. In the fifteen years following its founding, ELDI focused on rehabilitating some of the East Liberty's historic commercial spaces. These included the Regent Theater now called the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater and Motor Square Garden . ELDI's rehabilitation projects were time-consuming, and they did not make the neighborhood the destination for shoppers that it had formerly been. For example, ELDI and the Massaro Corporation recreated the Motor Square Garden building as an indoor mall in 1988, but consumers did not respond. The American Automobile Association bought the building in bankruptcy court in 1991 and now uses it as office space. In addition to its moderately successful property rehabilitation efforts during the 1980s, ELDI was able to remove the failed pedestrian mall on Penn Avenue and return that thoroughfare to its traditional use as a two-way street . These successes set the stage for a large and somewhat controversial series of developments in the late 1990s and 2000s. Between 1996 and 2006, ELDI and the City of Pittsburgh worked to attract new big box retailers to East Liberty and to remove the 20-story housing projects that surrounded the neighborhood. First, ELDI and the City used tax increment financing to lure two national retailers to the neighborhood: Home Depot and Whole Foods. Both of these stores thrived, and their success convinced small local merchants and other national retailers to invest in the neighborhood. Second, after a complex and time-consuming set of transactions, two of the three housing projects that visually barricaded the neighborhood were demolished in 2005, and the third was demolished in May 2009. The EastSide development in East Liberty. Because these efforts involved resettling the largely African-American population of East Liberty's housing projects and attracting several high-end retailers, ELDI and the City have been criticized for acting as agents of Gentrification . Some of these concerns have been assuaged by new mixed-income residential developments which have begun to replace the demolished housing projects, as the new developments provide arguably nicer and safer accommodations for some of the projects former residents - but much fewer of them. By 2009, East Liberty more closely resembled the busy commercial neighborhood of 1959 than the struggling ghetto of 1979. Merchants continue to invest in the neighborhood, and outside observers consider it to be fully rehabilitated. In 2010, The New York Times published an article about the revival of East Liberty, and cited the presence of a Google office as a sign of the neighborhood's success. In 2011, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published an article entitled The trend toward shared working areas arrives which describes the creation of The Beauty Shoppe, East Liberty's first Coworking space. The space is owned by East Liberty Development Inc and currently houses several start ups and small businesses. The first business tenant was Thinktiv, Inc., a venture accelerator. Thinktiv was part of The Beauty Shoppe redevelopment effort alongside East Liberty Development Inc. and Edile, a real estate development firm. The Highland Building hi-rise, vacant for 20 years, has been converted into luxurious apartments, as has the adjacent Wallace Building, through Walnut Capital, a local real estate company that also owns part of Bakery Square. In April 2014, the streets making up Penn Circle were renamed, removing a highly visible reminder of the failed urban renewal plans of the 1960s. Several historic street names were restored, and Centre Avenue was extended beyond its original pre-1968 terminus at Penn Avenue to East Liberty Boulevard, affording visitors to the neighborhood a less confusing path toward the business district. In June 2014, USA Today named East Liberty one of the ten best up and coming neighborhoods around the USA. East Liberty is served by the East Liberty station, also called the East Liberty Transit Center, on the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway . This station was redeveloped in 2015. The publicly funded project aimed at transit-oriented development , placing residents and retail in close proximity to mass transit in order to encourage urban density and discourage automobile use. The transit center increases accessibility to the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway that runs along the ravine where the Pennsylvania Railroad once ran. The busway connects Downtown with East End neighborhoods and eastern suburbs of Allegheny County. This 150 million project covers a total of 6 acres and added 3000 square feet of mixed-use commercial space. This project has been a catalyst for heated debates in the past three years about the lack of affordable housing in East Liberty. The project's tax abatement program, which is meant to encourage development in the East Liberty transit district , has resulted in public funds being granted to private developers for high-end development, including hundreds of luxury apartments. In 2009, the Remnant Choir from East Liberty's Mt. Ararat Baptist Church won second place, and 20,000 in prize money, in a national contest that was sponsored by Verizon Wireless , and was designed to find the Best Church Choir in America. Legendary actor and dancer Gene Kelly was born in East Liberty in 1912. David Tepper , a business man, owner of the NFL 's Carolina Panthers and the MLS 's Charlotte FC lived in East Liberty.

The museum achieved non-profit status in 1977. Over the next forty years, Luderowski would attract upcoming installation artists to fill its rooms. The Mattress Factory along with its neighbors City of Asylum and Randyland are credited with playing a role in Pittsburgh's revitalization. In 1975, artist and Mattress Factory founder Barbara Luderowski purchased a former Stearns Foster mattress warehouse at 500 Sampsonia Way in Pittsburgh's Central Northside . Originally, she used the warehouse as a space to live, work and build a community of artists and intellectuals. The community grew and in 1977 after two years of hosting art exhibits and a small food co-op the Mattress Factory was established as a legal non-profit educational and cultural corporation. Its first exhibition of installation art opened five years later on May 8, 1982, and the museum has since grown to be an integral part of the Pittsburgh arts community, known for its artist residency program, educational programming, and unique exhibitions. In 2008 then-Curator of Exhibitions Michael Olijnyk joined Luderowski in leading the museum as co-director. Over the years the Mattress Factory has acquired more properties for various purposes, including: 1414 Monterey Street, which became a new gallery space Two buildings on North Taylor Street that became artist residences 505 Jacksonia Street, which is now used as a parking lot for museum visitors, and the adjacent lot, which now houses Winifred Lutz's Garden Installation , 1993 516 Sampsonia Way, which opened as gallery space in Fall 2013 In September 2018, a report published in Pittsburgh's WESA detailed five employees' allegations of sexual misconduct and the mishandling of the situation by the Mattress Factory and its director, Michael Olijnyk. The complaint was filed with the National Labor Relations Board, and in early January 2019, a settlement was reached and the investigation was closed. As of 2024 , the Mattress Factory hosts 20 long-term installations . The following is a list: Official websiteCentral Northside is a neighborhood in the North Side of the city of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania. It has a zip code of 15212, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 6 DowntownNorthshore Neighborhoods. Originally known as The Buena Vista Tract, it is densely filled with restored row houses, community gardens and tree lined streets and alleyways. In the late 19th century, Allegheny, Pennsylvania later annexed by Pittsburgh became known for its stately homes, occupied by some of the area's wealthy families. One such area became known as the Mexican War Streets . The Mexican War Streets were laid out in 1847, during the Mexican American War , by William Robinson Jr. , ex-mayor of the city of Allegheny. Robinson, who contrary to some tellings did not actually serve in the war, subdivided his land and named the new streets after the war's battles and generals Buena Vista Street, Filson Way, Monterey Street, Palo Alto Street, Resaca Place, Sherman Avenue, Taylor Avenue. The Central Northside neighborhood has 4 distinct flights of city steps. In Central Northside, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and neighborhood schools.

Central Northside has seven city neighborhood borders with Perry South to the north, Fineview to the northeast, East Allegheny to the southeast, Allegheny Center to the south, Allegheny West to the southwest, Manchester to the west and California-Kirkbride to the northwest. The 1979 sportscult classic The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh used the neighborhoods southern border of North Avenue's gritty former burlesque row adjacent to the Garden Theater to depict Stockard Channing 's gypsy fortune teller characters office and residence. Thirty years later, in 2010, the Katherine Heigl film One for the Money uses the same exact buildings complete with Garden Theater marquee to once again depict a gritty inner city environment though much of the characters and vice of the North Avenue corridor has been corrected, the structures still adapt well on the areas southern border. On 10 September 2012, the Central Northside Neighborhood Council CNNC voted to change the neighborhood's name to Allegheny City Central. However, according to an FAQ published by the CNNC in August 2012, the Council reported that official city maps would probably not reflect the name change and that the city planning department is always very reluctant to alter established names. The same document refers to the name change as a branding initiative which is part of a new brand and marketing strategy.

Kamin Science Center , is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . It is located in the Chateau neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium . The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year. Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium which features the latest in digital projection technology, the Rangos Giant Theater promoted as the biggest screen in Pittsburgh, a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University s Robot Hall of Fame in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema, SportsWorks , the Miniature Railroad Village , and the USS Requin a World War II submarine . According to Nicholas Efran, The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years. However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations . In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC 's Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the 10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs. In June of 2022, Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame , such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars , Maria from Metropolis , as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey , were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid , the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage until the Science Center decides what to do with it. Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science , which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States , and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute under the leadership of Robert Wilburn stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the 40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas , which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger. The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991. On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022. It was touted as the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition, with more than 30 interactive displays featuring all things robotic. Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid , the Robothespian, an interactive , animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort. The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2 , C-3PO , Data , the T-800 Terminator , R.O.B. , Maschinenmensch , Gort , Robby the Robot , Robot B-9 , HAL 9000 , and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running . Highmark SportsWorks formerly UPMC SportsWorks is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center. It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate. The main idea of SportsWorks is to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports. SportsWorks features three themed areas: Physics of Sports exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc., LifeWorks featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle, and Sports Challenge demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports. The previous sponsor, UPMC , ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot 1,100 m SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark . It reopened in the Fall of 2009. From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition . At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit. A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit , then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector , an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh. The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri. It was installed in 2000 with a computerized lighting system. In 2008 a storm damaged the cone, thus it underwent upgrades to its lighting system with an addition of energy-efficient bulbs. At night, it is lit with different colors, signalling the weather forecast from WTAE-TV for the coming day.

The community was named after a tavern once located there. Like nearby Squirrel Hill , it contains a large Jewish population, but is still majority Catholic and contributes to a high percentage of students enrolled in Taylor Allderdice High School , Oakland Catholic High School , and Central Catholic High School . The most prominent feature of Point Breeze is Henry Clay Frick 's Clayton, which is a part of the 5.5-acre 2.2 ha Frick Art Historical Center . Nearby is St. Bede School, a Catholic school, and the Pittsburgh New Church School. It is also the home to two Pittsburgh Public Schools , Linden Academy elementary school and Sterrett Middle School , and the Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary . The neighborhood also hosts much open space, with Westinghouse Park , Mellon Park , the scenic Homewood Cemetery , as well as the northern edge of Frick Park within its borders. Pulitzer Prize winner Annie Dillard 's popular memoir , An American Childhood , is set in Point Breeze during the 1950s. As a child she attended Park Place Elementary . Both of John Edgar Wideman 's memoirs, Brothers and Keepers and Hoop Roots , use North Point Breeze's Westinghouse Park as a setting, as well as in his fictional Homewood Trilogy . Although officially distinct neighborhoods separated by Penn Avenue , Point Breeze is also frequently taken to include North Point Breeze . Point Breeze has six borders, five with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of North Point Breeze to the north, Regent Square to the southeast, Squirrel Hill South to the south and southwest, Squirrel Hill North to the west, and Shadyside to the northwest. The other border is with the borough of Wilkinsburg to the east. Point Breeze also runs catty-corner without a direct border with the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Larimer to the north at the intersection of Penn and Fifth Avenues This intersection also serves as an east west diagonal for the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Shadyside and North Point Breeze. The eastern edge of the neighborhood, north of Regent Square and east of Frick Park , comprises the neighborhood of Park Place . The Shady Side Academy Junior School sits here, as does Environmental Charter School , a Pittsburgh Public School that operates as a charter school in the building originally known as Park Place School .

Frick Art Historical CenterThe Pittsburgh Glass Center is a gallery, glass studio, and public-access school dedicated to teaching, creating and promoting studio glass art. It is located on Penn Avenue in the Friendship neighborhood of Pittsburgh . It has features works by Paul Joseph Stankard and classes taught by Dante Marioni , Davide Salvadore, and Cesare Toffolo. The origins of the Pittsburgh Glass Center date to 1991, when David Stephens, then visual-arts officer of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts , approached glass artists Ron Desmett and Kathleen Mulcahy, then a professor at Carnegie Mellon University , about the idea of a center for studio glass. It was originally to have been the Elizabeth Glass Center in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania . However, by 1999, the plans had changed and the center was re-oriented to Pittsburgh. It was officially opened in 2001. The current facility in Friendship is LEED-certified . Its development has aided the growth of Garfield , especially with the adjacent Glass Lofts residential development. In fall 2010, the Pittsburgh Glass Center entered into talks with Pittsburgh Filmmakers Pittsburgh Center for the Arts . By May 2011, the talks had failed, with the Pittsburgh Glass Center withdrawing from negotiations. In 2012, the Glass Center purchased residential housing adjacent to its main gallery space to be used as student and artist-in-residence housing . By 2012, the center had a 1 million budget, with 10 full-time employees.Garfield is a neighborhood in the East End of the City of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States. Garfield is bordered on the South by Bloomfield and Friendship at Penn Avenue , on the West by the Allegheny Cemetery at Mathilda Street, on the North by Stanton Heights at Mossfield Street, and on the East by East Liberty at Negley Avenue. Like many parts of Pittsburgh , Garfield is a fairly steep neighborhood, with north-south residential streets running at about a 20 incline from Penn Avenue at the bottom to Mossfield Street at the top. Garfield is divided into the valley and the hilltop. Garfield is part of District 9 on the Pittsburgh City Council, and is currently represented by Rev. Ricky Burgess. The Garfield neighborhood has 13 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Garfield, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and the Penn Avenue business corridor and provide an easy way to access the Fort Pitt Playground and neighborhood parklets. The recently refurbished N Winebiddle Street city steps in Garfield. Photo by Laura Zurowski. Like nearby Bloomfield and Friendship , the land comprising modern-day Garfield was acquired by Casper Taub from the local Delaware tribe . Taub sold it to his son-in-law, Joseph Conrad Winebiddle, in the late 18th century. About a hundred years later, Winebiddle's descendants broke the family estate into lots and sold them to new residents of an expanding City of Pittsburgh . The first owner of a lot in present-day Garfield bought his plot in 1881, on the day that U.S. President James Garfield was buried, so the neighborhood was named for the late President. Garfield's earliest settlers were predominantly blue-collar Irish laborers and their families, who worked in the mills and foundries down along the Allegheny River, shopped in local stores on Penn Avenue, and built and lived in modest brick foursquare homes on the streets running up from Penn Avenue. The community, then almost exclusively Catholic, built St. Lawrence O'Toole Parish on Penn Avenue in 1897. From 1880 until about 1960, the neighborhood remained as it began: a solid, working-class area. Neighborhood activist Aggie Brose described Garfield in 1960 as a place where You sponsored each other's kids, you went to all the weddings and funerals, you never wanted for a baby-sitter, you never had to call a repairman, you didn't need for a social. When you put the kids to bed, the women went out on the stoops. Things changed in the 1960s, when some Garfield residents began to leave the City for nearby suburbs in Shaler and Penn Hills. In response, the City's Urban Redevelopment Authority URA used eminent domain and attempted to change nearby East Liberty from an urban shopping area, then the third-busiest retail center in Pennsylvania, to a suburban one. The URA knocked down many small shops, accessible on foot or by bus, and thereby opened land for larger ones, accessible by car. At the same time, the City's housing authority built several massive public housing complexes on Garfield's borders: Garfield Heights, a 600 unit complex high up on Fern Street, and the East Mall, a 20 story tower straddling Penn Avenue at the entrance to East Liberty. These changes, designed to halt the slow trickle of Garfield residents to the suburbs, instead turned a trickle into a torrent. East Liberty lost most of its businesses, and the new housing projects, inhabited by poor African-Americans, unnerved Garfield residents. In 1969 the federal government gave the City funds to enforce housing codes in Garfield so that as old residents fled, their homes were not allowed to deteriorate. This move also backfired: long-time residents, told that homes built in 1900 and often passed through families over the years did not meet codes written in 1960, moved away rather than pay for upgrades. Thus began a textbook case of white flight : in 1970, Garfield had a population of roughly 10,000 people, 80 of them white. In 2000, Garfield's population had been cut almost in half to 5,450 people, 83 of them black. To halt what they perceived as the neighborhood's decline, in 1975 parishioners at St. Lawrence O'Toole founded the Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation BGC, a Community Development Corporation that uses private and government funds and activism to encourage home ownership and business development. Over the years, the organization has built or renovated dozens of housing units, and renovated commercial properties for dozens of small businesses, from restaurants to art galleries to theater companies. In the 1980s, a similar group called the Garfield Jubilee Association formed, with a goal of creating affordable housing. In recent years, the two groups have joined together in a joint project to build dozens of new single-family homes. In 2000, the BGC and Friendship Development Associates, Inc. formed the Penn Avenue Arts Initiative. The PAAI encourages artists to live and work along the Avenue by rehabbing properties, making small loans or grants for facade renovations, and organizing joint marketing events such as Unblurred, held the first Friday of each month, where the venues of Garfield and Friendship open for special events. Efforts by groups like these, along with a recent recognition that massive, 1960s-style social welfare projects often had negative consequences, have helped to revitalize the neighborhood. Commercially, Penn Avenue is recovering from the flight of local businesses in the 1970s and 1980s. Some bastions of the old neighborhood remain, as groups like the BGC and GJA, and FDA have worked to keep some banks and stores along Penn Avenue. Since 1990, these have been joined by newcomers: African-American barbershops and salons, tiny family-owned Vietnamese restaurants, and a series of arts-related businesses e.g., theatres, galleries, an architecture studio, a glass factory, a coffeeshop, and much more attracted by the PAAI. There has also been some positive residential development: the East Mall and Garfield Heights Senior highrise was razed in 2005, and the townhouse units are scheduled to be demolished in 2007 2008, and replaced with mixed-income units, as well as new replacement homes scattered through the neighborhood. Visitors to Garfield today will see a neighborhood on the rise, a formerly blighted community that is now becoming a vibrant community, with a focus on the arts, while not forgetting its roots 1 .

It is widely regarded as one of America 's most colorful public art landmarks. Randy Gilson is the founder of this museum, which showcases found object art. Randyland has played an important role in the cultural rejuvenation of Pittsburgh, with its neighbors City of Asylum and Mattress Factory . Randyland has received international attention through viral listicles , and is among the most photographed places on Instagram . Randy Gilson talking to visitors at Randyland Randy Gilson was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania . Early in life he suffered from homelessness and poverty. He moved to Pittsburgh's Northside in 1982, where he was a community activist , planting over 800 street gardens and 50 vegetable gardens. His guerrilla gardening planted vacant lots in Manchester , the Mexican War Streets , and surrounding neighborhoods. He bought the property that would become Randyland on a credit card for 10,000 in 1995. Using upcycling, Gilson decorates his home with items such as mannequins, plastic dinosaurs and pink flamingos. The fences display murals with neighbors dancing and smiling. In late 2016, Gilson's partner David Paul Francis Mac McDermott was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer . Upon hearing the news, Randyland fans raised over 20,000 and sent Gilson and McDermott on their first vacation. The couple visited the Grand Canyon and Hollywood . Afterwards, Gilson retired from his restaurant job to spend more time with the ailing McDermott. Following the announcement, Foo Conner joined Randyland as co-director. The neighborhood around the museum experienced explosive growth in 2016-2019. Randyland itself reportedly doubled in attendance. The courtyard was overhauled to accommodate the traffic. Under Conner's curation, the facility embraced being a selfie museum as a vibrant backdrop for photos. McDermott died on January 10, 2019. As Gilson's partner, he was posthumously given the title of co-founder. Journalists noted that McDermott may have downplayed his role when alive but was a backbone of the museum. Later that year, Randyland received the Mayor's Award for Public Art for 2019. Conner left the museum early 2020. Because it is outdoors, Randyland was one of the only art museums open in Pennsylvania during the COVID-19 pandemic . Gilson came out of retirement. The Courtyard was changed to a socially distanced playground throughout quarantine. Many of the original murals have been painted over. As of 2022, Randyland is still a free and popular tourist attraction. The documentary The Spirit of Pittsburgh features Randy Gilson's gardening alongside Fred Rogers . The documentary Pursuing Happiness features Randy Gilson as one of the happiest people in America. When a blizzard postponed Guster 's Pittsburgh concert, they instead recorded a viral music video in the alleyway near Randyland. Randy Gilson succeeded Rick Sebak as the Mardi Gras King of Pittsburgh. A teenager's Summer Bucket List 2017, which included Randyland as a place to visit, went viral.

Mayor's Award for Public Art 2019 Official websiteAdolf W lfli 's Irren-Anstalt Band-Hain , 1910 Anna Zem nkov , No title, 1960s Outsider art is art made by self-taught individuals who are untrained and untutored in the traditional arts with typically little or no contact with the conventions of the art worlds . The term outsider art was coined in 1972 as the title of a book by art critic Roger Cardinal . It is an English equivalent for art brut French: a b yt , raw art or rough art, a label created in the 1940s by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside the boundaries of official culture. Dubuffet focused particularly on art by those on the outside of the established art scene, using as examples psychiatric hospital patients, hermits, and spiritualists. Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category an annual Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1993, and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to the subject. The term is sometimes applied as a marketing label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream art world or art gallery system, regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work. A more specific term, outsider music , was later adapted for musicians. Interest in the art of the mentally ill, along with that of children and the makers of peasant art , developed from the end of the 19th century onward, both by psychiatrists such as Cesare Lombroso , Auguste Marie or Marcel R j , and by artists, such as members of Der Blaue Reiter group: Wassily Kandinsky , August Macke , Franz Marc , Alexej von Jawlensky , and others. What the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication. Examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first and only issue of their publication, Der Blaue Reiter Almanac . During World War I , Macke was killed at Champagne in 1914 and Marc was killed at Verdun in 1916 the gap left by these deaths was to some extent filled by Paul Klee , who continued to draw inspiration from these 'primitives'. Interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the 1920s. In 1921, Dr. Walter Morgenthaler published his book Ein Geisteskranker als K nstler A Psychiatric Patient as Artist about Adolf W lfli , a psychotic mental patient in his care. W lfli had spontaneously taken up drawing, and this activity seemed to calm him. His most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in which he narrated his own imaginary life story. With 25,000 pages, 1,600 illustrations, and 1,500 collages, it is a monumental work. W lfli also produced a large number of smaller works, some of which were sold or given as gifts. His work is on display at the Adolf W lfli Foundation in the Museum of Fine Art , Bern . A defining moment was the publication of Bildnerei der Geisteskranken Artistry of the Mentally Ill in 1922, by Hans Prinzhorn . This was the first formal study of psychiatric works, based upon a compilation of thousands of examples from European institutions. The book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time, including Paul Klee, Max Ernst , and Jean Dubuffet . People with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness, and may also be institutionalized. For example, William Kurelek , later awarded the Order of Canada for his artistic life work, as a young man was admitted to the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia . In the hospital he painted, producing The Maze , a dark depiction of his tortured youth . He was transferred from the Maudsley to Netherne Hospital from November 1953 to January 1955, to work with Edward Adamson 1911 1996, a pioneer of art therapy , and creator of the Adamson Collection. View inside the Collection de l'art brut museum, Lausanne French artist Jean Dubuffet was particularly struck by Bildnerei der Geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art, which he called art brut or raw art . In 1948 he formed the Compagnie de l'Art Brut along with other artists, including Andr Breton and Claude L vi-Strauss . The collection he established became known as the Collection de l'art brut and the curator was Slavko Kopa for almost three decades. It contains thousands of works and is now permanently housed in Lausanne , Switzerland. Dubuffet characterized art brut as: Those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic creative impulses where the worries of competition, acclaim and social promotion do not interfere are, because of these very facts, more precious than the productions of professionals. After a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness, lived so fully and so intensely by their authors, we cannot avoid the feeling that in relation to these works, cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society, a fallacious parade. Jean Dubuffet, Place l'incivisme December 1987 February 1988. Dubuffet argued that 'culture', that is mainstream culture, managed to assimilate every new development in art, and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had. The result was to asphyxiate genuine expression. Art brut was his solution to this problem only art brut was immune to the influences of culture, immune to being absorbed and assimilated, because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated. Dubuffet's championing of Art Brut would not last long. Scholars argue Dubuffet's distaste for the mainstream art world helped ensure that art brut and the Compagnie de l'Art Brut would not survive on a commercial basis. Dubuffet would kill art brut as he defined it in his quest for its authenticity. Three years after the Compagnie de l'Art Brut was formed, Dubuffet dissolved it, caving in to form the more conventional Collection de l'art brut afterward. The interest in outsider practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu. The early part of the 20th century gave rise to Cubism and the Dada , Constructivist , and Futurist movements in art, all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past. Dadaist Marcel Duchamp , for example, abandoned painterly technique to allow chance operations a role in determining the form of his works, or simply to recontextualize existing ready-made objects as art. Mid-century artists, including Pablo Picasso , looked outside the traditions of high culture for inspiration, drawing from the artifacts of primitive societies, the unschooled art made by children, and vulgar advertising graphics. Dubuffet's championing of the art brut of the insane and others at the margins of society is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values. As with analysis of these other art movements, current discourse indicates art brut is innately tied to primitivism due to its similarity in its borrowing of personal de-patriation and exoticization of familiar yet alien forms. A number of terms are used to describe art that is loosely understood as outside of official culture . Definitions of these terms vary and overlap. The editors of Raw Vision , a leading journal in the field, suggest that Whatever views we have about the value of controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by way of an agreed vocabulary. Consequently, they lament the use of outsider artist to refer to almost any untrained artist. It is not enough to be untrained, clumsy or na ve. Outsider Art is virtually synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name. Art Brut: Coined by Jean Dubuffet, the term translated literally from French means raw art. 'Raw' is analogous in that it has not been through the academic 'cooking' process: i.e. the world of art schools, galleries, and museums. Dubuffet's original definition pertains strictly to the raw art created by the autodidactic and shunned fringes of society. Folk art : Folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative skills associated with peasant communities in Europe though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and decorative skill everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values, where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to society's mainstream. Intuitive art Visionary art : Raw Vision Magazine ' s preferred general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate umbrella terms. However, visionary art, unlike other definitions here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art is probably the most general term available. Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art based in Chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art. The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art. Marginal artArt singulier: Essentially the same as Neuve Invention refers to artists on the margins of the art world. Na ve art : Another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to normal artistic status, i.e. they have a much more conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do outsider artists. Neuve invention : Used to describe artists who, although marginal, have some interaction with mainstream culture. They may be doing art part-time for instance. The expression was coined by Dubuffet too strictly speaking, it refers only to a special part of the Collection de l'art brut . Visionary environments : Buildings and sculpture parks built by visionary artists ranging from decorated houses to large areas incorporating a large number of individual sculptures with a tightly associated theme. Examples include Watts Towers by Simon Rodia , Buddha Park and Sala Keoku by Bunleua Sulilat , and The Palais id al by Ferdinand Cheval .

He wrote more than 200 songs, including Oh Susanna , Hard Times Come Again No More , Camptown Races , Old Folks at Home Swanee River , My Old Kentucky Home , Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair , Old Black Joe , and Beautiful Dreamer , and many of his compositions remain popular today. Foster's parents, Eliza Tomlinson Foster and William Barclay Foster There are many biographies of Foster, but details differ widely. Among other issues, Foster wrote very little biographical information himself, and his brother Morrison Foster may have destroyed much information that he judged to reflect negatively upon the family. Foster was born on July 4, 1826, in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania . His parents, William Barclay Foster and Eliza Clayland Tomlinson Foster , were of Ulster Scots and English descent. He had three older sisters and six older brothers. He attended private academies in Allegheny , Athens , and Towanda, Pennsylvania , and received an education in English grammar, diction, the classics, penmanship, Latin, Greek, and mathematics. Foster taught himself to play the clarinet, guitar, flute, and piano. In 1839, his brother William was serving his apprenticeship as an engineer at Towanda and thought that Stephen would benefit from being under the supervision of Henry Kleber 1816 1897, a German-born music dealer in Pittsburgh. Under Kleber, Stephen was exposed to music composition . Together the pair studied the work of Mozart , Beethoven , Weber , Mendelssohn and Schubert . The site of the Camptown Races which would provide both the title and setting for events of one of Foster's best-known songs was located 30 miles 48 km from Athens and 15 miles 24 km from Towanda. Foster's education included a brief period at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania , now part of Washington Jefferson College . His tuition was paid, but he had little spending money. He left Canonsburg to visit Pittsburgh with another student and did not return. House in Hoboken, New Jersey where Foster is believed to have written Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair in 1854 Foster married Jane Denny McDowell on July 22, 1850, and they visited New York and Baltimore on their honeymoon. Foster then returned to Pennsylvania and wrote most of his best-known songs: Camptown Races 1850, Nelly Bly 1850, Ring de Banjo 1851, Old Folks at Home known also as Swanee River, 1851, My Old Kentucky Home 1853, Old Dog Tray 1853, and Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair 1854, written for his wife Jane. Many of Foster's songs were used in the blackface minstrel shows popular at the time. He sought to build up taste...among refined people by making words suitable to their taste, instead of the trashy and really offensive words which belong to some songs of that order. However, Foster's output of minstrel songs declined after the early 1850s, as he turned primarily to parlor music . Many of his songs had Southern themes , yet Foster never lived in the South and visited it only once, during his 1852 honeymoon. Available archival evidence does not suggest that Foster was an abolitionist. Foster's last four years were spent in New York City. There is little information on this period of his life, although family correspondence has been preserved. A Pittsburgh Press illustration of the original headstone on Stephen Foster's grave Foster became sick with a fever in January 1864. Weakened, it is possible he fell in his hotel in the Bowery and cut his neck he may also have sought to take his own life. His writing partner George Cooper found him still alive but lying in a pool of blood. Foster died in Bellevue Hospital three days later at the age of 37. His leather wallet contained a scrap of paper that simply said, Dear friends and gentle hearts, along with 37 cents in Civil War scrip and three pennies. Other biographers describe different accounts of his death. Historian JoAnne O'Connell speculates in her biography, The Life and Songs of Stephen Foster , that Foster may have killed himself. As O'Connell and musicologist Ken Emerson have noted, several of the songs Foster wrote during the last years of his life foreshadow his death, such as The Little Ballad Girl and Kiss Me Dear Mother Ere I Die. Emerson says in his 2010 Stephen Foster and Co. that Foster's injuries may have been accidental or self-inflicted. Telegram that communicated Stephen Foster's death addressed to his brother Morrison Foster The note inside Foster's wallet is said to have inspired Bob Hilliard 's lyric for Dear Hearts and Gentle People 1949. Foster was buried in the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh. After his death, Morrison Foster became his literary executor. As such, he answered requests for copies of manuscripts, autographs, and biographical information. After his death, Beautiful Dreamer , one of the best-loved of his works, was posthumously published in 1864. Foster grew up in Lawrenceville, now a neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where many European immigrants had settled and were accustomed to hearing the music of the Italian, Scots-Irish , and German residents. He composed his first song when he was 14 and entitled it the Tioga Waltz. The first song that he had published was Open thy Lattice Love 1844. He wrote songs in support of drinking, such as My Wife Is a Most Knowing Woman, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, and When the Bowl Goes Round, while also composing temperance songs such as Comrades Fill No Glass for Me or The Wife. Foster also authored many church hymns, although the inclusion of his hymns in hymnals ended by 1910. Some of the hymns are Seek and ye shall find, All around is bright and fair, While we work for Jesus, and Blame not those who weep and sigh. Several rare Civil War-era hymns by Foster were performed by The Old Stoughton Musical Society Chorus, including The Pure, The Bright, The Beautiful, Over The River, Give Us This Day, and What Shall The Harvest Be. He also arranged many works by Mozart , Beethoven , Donizetti , Lanner , Weber and Schubert for flute and guitar. Foster usually sent his handwritten scores directly to his publishers. The publishers kept the sheet music manuscripts and did not give them to libraries nor return them to his heirs. Some of his original, hand-written scores were bought and put into private collections and the Library of Congress . My Old Kentucky Home is the official state song of Kentucky, adopted by the General Assembly on March 19, 1928. Foster's songs, lyrics, and melodies have often been altered by publishers and performers. In 1957 Ray Charles released a version of Old Folks at Home that was titled Swanee River Rock Talkin Bout That River, which became his first pop hit that November. In the 2000s Old Folks at Home , designated the official state song of Florida in 1935, came under attack for what some regarded as offensive terms in the song's lyrics. Changes were made to them with the approval of the Stephen Foster Memorial . The modified song was kept as the official state song, while Florida Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky was added as the state anthem. A 1974 published collection, Stephen Foster Song Book Original Sheet Music of 40 Songs New York : Dover Publications, Inc., of Stephen Foster's popular songs was edited by musicologist Richard Jackson .

Foster's Blues. Walt Kelly recorded an a cappella rendition of Foster's Old Dog Tray on the 1956 album, Songs of the Pogo . Kelly regularly referenced Old Dog Tray as the theme song for his character, Beauregard Hound Dog, from his comic strip, Pogo . Erika M. Anderson, of the band EMA, refers to Foster's Camptown Races in the song California, from past Life Martyred Saints 2011: I bet my money on the bobtail nagsomebody bet on the bay. The Firesign Theatre makes many references to Foster's compositions in their CD, Boom Dot Bust 1999, Rhino Records Larry Kirwan of Black 47 mixes the music of Foster with his own in the musical Hard Times , which earned a New York Times accolade in its original run: a knockout entertainment. Kirwan gives a contemporary interpretation of Foster's troubled later years and sets it in the tumultuous time of the New York draft riots and the Irish Negro relations of the period. A revival ran at the Cell Theater in New York in early 2014, and a revised version of the musical called Paradise Square opened at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2018. Gordon Lightfoot wrote a song in 1970 titled Your Love's Return Song for Stephen Foster Randy Newman 's 1970 album 12 Songs contained Newman's song Old Kentucky Home originally titled Turpentine and Dandelion Wine, which is based on Foster's My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night Newman told Billboard magazine, It's a good song because Stephen Foster wrote the hook, that's why. Under various titles, Newman's Old Kentucky Home was covered by the Beau Brummels , the Alan Price Set and Johnny Cash . Spike Jones recorded a comedy send-up I Dream of Brownie with the Light Blue Jeans. Humorist Stan Freberg imagined a 1950s style version of Foster's music in Rock Around Stephen Foster and, with Harry Shearer , had a sketch about Foster having writer's block in a bit from his United States of America project. Songwriter Tom Shaner mentions Stephen Foster meeting up with Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady on the Bowery in Shaner's song Rock Roll is A Natural Thing. The music of Stephen Foster was an early influence on the Australian composer Percy Grainger , who stated that hearing Camptown Races sung by his mother was one of his earliest musical recollections. He went on to write a piece entitled Tribute to Foster, a composition for mixed choir, orchestra, and pitched wine glasses based on the melody of Camptown Races. Art Garfunkel was cast as Stephen Foster and sang his songs in an elementary school play in Queens, New York Foster's name is included in the rapid fire litany of musicians and songs that make up the lyrics of the 1974 pop novelty song Life Is a Rock But the Radio Rolled Me by Reunion.

In the film Tombstone 1993, Billy Clanton played by Thomas Haden Church tries to bait Doc Holliday Val Kilmer , who is playing a Chopin nocturne on the piano, by saying, Is that 'Old Dog Tray' That sounds like 'Old Dog Tray' to me. When the goad fails, Clanton asks whether Doc knows any other songs, like 'Camptown Races', 'Oh Susanna', You know, Stephen stinkin' Foster In the film A Million Ways to Die in the West , Seth MacFarlane 's character, Albert can't get Foster's song If You've Only Got a Mustache, from the previous scene, out of his head.

The Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx , overlooking the Harlem River, has a bronze bust of him by artist Walker Hancock . Added in 1940, he is among only 98 honorees from 15 classes of distinguished men and women.

A 1900 statue of Foster by Giuseppe Moretti was located in Schenley Plaza , in Pittsburgh, from 1940 until 2018. On the unanimous recommendation of the Pittsburgh Art Commission, the statue was removed on April 26, 2018. Its new home has not yet been determined. It has a long reputation as the most controversial public art in Pittsburgh for its depiction of an African-American banjo player at the feet of the seated composer. Critics say the statue glorifies white appropriation of black culture and depicts the vacantly smiling musician in a way that is at best condescending and at worst racist. A city-appointed Task Force on Women in Public Art called for the statue to be replaced with one honoring an African American woman with ties to the Pittsburgh community. The Task Force held a series of community forums in Pittsburgh to collect public feedback on the statue replacement and circulated an online form which allowed the public to vote for one of seven previously selected candidates or write in an alternate suggestion. However, the Task Force on Women in Public Art and the Pittsburgh Art Commission have not reached an agreement as to who will be commemorated or if the statue will stay in the Schenley Plaza location. The musicologist Ken Emerson has suggested the presence of racism in some of Foster's lyrics. Stephen Foster Collection and archive Emerson, Ken, ed. 2010.

From skulls to car crashes, both artists deploy their signature bright colors and pop culture references while also presenting the lurid spectacle of death. The dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time. KAWS will also respond to Warhol s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures, and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some of America s most loved cereal boxes including Reese s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will be juxtaposed with Warhol s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children. In response to The Warhol s new initiative The Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible from its entrance space.KAWS Warhol is presented by UNIQLO Major support provided by Nemacolin, Jim Spencer Michael Lin, and Kathe Jim Patrinos.

This exhibition features works by Andrew Wyeth, Arthur Dove, Milton Avery, and others. The Great Search s title references American Art Today, the World s Fair exhibition held in New York City in 1939. Organizer Holger Cahill, then national director of the Federal Art Project, spoke in his address of the modern artist s search that takes many paths a yearning desire to seek out new and enduring forms that would aid democracy. One of The Westmoreland s best-known and loved paintings, Ernest Fiene s Night Shift, Aliquippa 1936, was included in this pivotal presentation. Drawn primarily from The Westmoreland s collection, amplified by key loans from public and private collections, the exhibition will provide fresh insight into the individuals, experiences, and both new and traditional aesthetics that define American modern art.This exhibition is organized by Jeremiah William McCarthy, Chief Curator, The Westmoreland Museum of American Art.This is one in a series of American art exhibitions created through a multi-year, multi-institutional partnership formed by the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of the Art Bridges Cohort Program.

Throughout his storied career, he has entertained countless thousands as both headliner and supporting act for many legendary international artists - often performing for charitable organizations and their associated fund-raising events along the way. For many years, Rick contemplated a tribute to his iconic rock heroes - Freddie Mercury and Queen. Encouraged by the rising popularity of tribute shows across the globe, the time finally seemed right With the release of the smash hit, bio-pic Bohemian Rhapsody and the ensuing accolades and awards, Queen has been thrust back into the public consciousness - not only rekindling the affections of existing fans but gaining whole new generations of them It's clear without a doubt that Freddie Mercury is revered and beloved as one of the greatest vocalists, showmen and songwriters of all time and in that spirit, Rick has been belting out the songs and channeling Freddie's charisma and exuberance to sold-out audiences across North America and beyond for the past ten years now, thriving on the energy of his enthusiastic crowds from the moment he hits the stage More info is available about the show at: www.simplyqueen.liveOctober 17, 2024 7:30 PM 10:00 PMWaltz World Premiere QAThe Lindsay Theater and Cultural Center in Sewickley is hosting the theatrical premiere of Waltz, a locally made horror movie about a woman being tormented by a stalker.

Learn more about Bastard Bearded Irishmen: Pittsburgh-based Bastard Bearded Irishmen is one of the most entertaining and energetic live shows today. Their sound is an original, ferocious blend of traditional and contemporary Celtic music, mixed with punk, gypsy and high-energy rock n roll. Bastard Bearded Irishmen, or BBI, was originally intended to be a one-night-only tribute for a dear, departed friend. Jimmy Bastard and Ben Jaber shared a passion for Irish music and enlisted Dan Stocker on drums and Danny Rectenwald on mandolin to form the nucleus of the band. What began as a tribute in local pub gigs turned into two records with a third on the way, constant touring, sharing the stage with the likes of Street Dogs and Gogol Bordello and a sponsorship from Jameson Irish Whiskey. The group s lineup is rounded out by Paul Dvorchak on fiddle, Ryan Warmbrodt on rhythm guitar and Sean-Paul Williams on bass. These days, the band is having as much fun as ever. The shows are a non-stop barrage of party anthems, dancing tunes and maybe even the occasional whiskey-fueled ballad. The experience is always organic, and sometimes, unpredictable. Maybe Jimmy will climb into the rafters to do an epic guitar solo. Maybe Danny will jump into the crowd and lose his shirt sometimes pants. Quite simply, the guys want the crowd to let loose and party. One thing is for sure, the bar better be overstocked.October 18, 2024Bastard Bearded IrishmenHard Rock Cafe and CE Presents welcome Bastard Bearded Irishmen with special guest One Eye Daddys on Friday, October 18, 2024 Entry and seating for event attendees begin at 7:00 PM.

This event is open to all ages with alcohol available for purchase to attendees ages 21 and over. Valid identification is required for the purchase andor consumption of alcohol. Paid parking options are available to event attendees within the Station Square Complex. Learn more about Michale Graves: Michale Graves is an internationally recognized artist who has been creating music and telling stories for over two decades. Before his 20th birthday, he was recruited to be the lead singer and primary songwriter of the legendary punk band, the Misfits. Graves faced an uphill battle of immense criticism while trying to fill the shoes of original Misfits vocalist, Glenn Danzig, but he injected the group with freshness, youth and energy which rewrote the history of the band in a way that even his sharpest critics found undeniable, reaching a whole new generation of music fans in the process. Michale attributes his vocal capabilities to his time studying under Don Lawrence in New York City, who taught him to set himself apart with a powerful, rich, developed tenner that far surpassed the audience s expectations. Michale Graves kicked in the door of the music scene in 1995, wearing his trademark skull face paint, with a new take on the music he helped transform a punk band with a mythical reputation into a modern standout, performing nightly in front of packed areas and festivals. The videos for his songs Dig Up Her Bones and Scream directed by master of horror George A. Romero have been viewed over 30 million times. Michale appeared in Romero s film Bruiser performing Fiend Without a Face which was also written by Graves specifically for the film. During professional wrestling s hottest period Graves along with his bandmates were seen every week by millions of viewers around the world as a regular attraction on WCW s Monday Nitro. After recording two albums with the Misfits, American Psycho with Geffen Records and Famous Monsters with Roadrunner Records, as well as touring the world to meet millions of fans, Graves quit the band to blaze his own path. Michale steadily built a reputation as the working-man s punk rocker. He reintroduced himself to the scene with non-stop touring around the country before taking his new act worldwide. By the mid-2000s Michale Graves could have rested on his laurels and looked back at a career full of self-made achievements, but he wanted something more. His passion motivated him to reach out, create a dialogue, and build platforms to start a conversation about culture, spirituality, and justice. Michale started a website called ConservativePunk.com to educate his fans on the rights of the individual, totally breaking with the status quo of what was expected of contemporary artists who come from the world of coulter-culture entertainment. Graves also spoke out on behalf of the police and military, after having a brief stint in the US Marines himself. This work got Graves mainstream attention once again, this time appearing opposite Ed Helms on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

In 2022, he makes his Rat Pak Records debut with High Voltage Blues, amplifying his soul and spirit like never before. I ve learned how to embrace my voice as a guitarist and as a singer, he states. I understand who I am, and I use my strengths to my advantage. I have a blues soul and a rock n roll heart. I love to jump back and forth between both with a modern day approach. When I play rock, it s got a little more dust to it. Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, he fell in love with music as a kid, listening to everyone from Muddy Waters and Jimi Hendrix to Jeff Beck and Eddie Van Halen. At 14 years old, Anthony gravitated to the guitar and his relationship with the instrument was born. After grinding it out, his chops caught the attention of B.B. King s bus driver at a jam night. Blown away, the driver introduced him to B.B. who invited him to open up a string of tour dates in 2005. Gaining invaluable knowledge from The King, he went on to share the stage with the likes of Buddy Guy, Robert Plant, Joe Bonamassa, Heart, Sammy Hagar, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and more. Along the way, his concert attendees have included Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman, John Goodman, and Vince Vaughn as well as Eric Clapton, to name a few. 2018 s Peace, Love Loud Guitars vaulted to 1 on the iTunes Top Blues Albums Chart and 1 on Amazon Music s New Release Blues Chart. Meanwhile, Guitar World readers voted him one of The 30 Best Blues Guitarists in the World Today in 2019, and the publication noted, Gomes is another power player who is at his best when his gear is in the scorched earth between blues and rock. After seven consecutive Top 10 debuts on the Billboard Blues Albums Chart, Containment Blues marked his second 1 on the respective chart in 2020. During 2021, he signed to Rat Pak Records and assembled High Voltage Blues, re-recording fan favorites from previous releases and cutting three new tunes. On five tracks, Ray Luzier of Korn and Billy Sheehan Mr. Big, David Lee Roth, The Winery Dogs handled drums and bass, respectively. Co-produced by Anthony and Peter Carson, sessions went down in St. Louis and Nashville. We had a lot of fun rocking these songs up, he observes. As an artist, it was great to circle back to some of my past work and look at it from a different perspective. Billy and Ray really pushed the way I play guitar, and they added a whole new element with a little insanity. When people ask me what I sound like, I say, If B.B. King was in ACDC, that s what it would be . That s High Voltage Blues in a nutshell. In the end, Anthony Gomes is just the kind of guitar hero we need for today. I m either the last of a dying breed or the start of a new revolution, he smiles. I still believe in a world of guitar heroes. I strive for a world where you don t have to be 19 years old to sell a lot of records and tickets and to make a statement. I m one of those people who doesn t think rock, or the blues is dead. I m looking for fresh ways to bring them together. I m at the table rolling the dice all in the name of blues and rock n roll. I know there s never been a more exciting time for music, and I m here for the journey.

Of the architects who left the largest footprints on Pittsburgh in the early part of the 20th century, Frederick Scheibler is perhaps the least-well known. A native of the City, born into a German family that had a creative bent, Scheibler was fortunate to work at the moment when the architecture field was starting to turn away from the historical styles that had preoccupied it for decades. As early as 1905, he demonstrated his ability to meld, in unique ways, early ideas about what would come to be called functionalism with an appreciation for decoration. He was, in the language of the time, a progressive even today, his largely residential oeuvre stands out stylistically from the work of most of his contemporaries. This virtual tour will trace the evolution of Scheibler s buildings, which one authority has described as a startling presence on the landscape.

Maple Syrup Festival Maple Taste Tour Weekend PA Maple Festival Big Day Entertainment Big Day Entertainment Little Italy Days started in 2002 to celebrate Bloomfield s Italian heritage, and create a destination spot for Italian-themed entertainment and food. The event has grown through the years and is now lasts four days. Sal Richetti, who was born and raised in Bloomfield has produced the event since 2012. Sal grew up in Bloomfield, attended Immaculate Conception grade school and Central Catholic High School. He is a local musician who has been performing for over 30 years in the tri-state area, and is the owner of Big Day Entertainment, located in the Strip District, since 1995. He is no stranger to the festival, having booked the entertainment in previous years. In 2013 he expanded it to four days. Previously, the event was always held in September, since 2013 it has mooved to August. I wanted to give vendors more opportunity with the longer daylight, additionally there is less chance of cold weather I am excited and honored to produce this community oriented event in the community where I was born and raised. I want to be able to produce Little Italy Days so the businesses can benefit from the large crowds and everyone else including residents, organizations, schools and churches can become involved. Sponsors of Little Italy Days include Official Sponsors Highmark Allegheny Health Network, Stage Sponsor Rohrich Shadyside Honda. Additional Sponsors include UPMC Shadyside, Children s Hospital of UPMC, PNC Bank, First National Bank, Mascaro, Pittsburgh Brewing Co. First Commonwealth Bank and Froggy s.HistoryThe story of the All-American dessert that started in Latrobe Since its invention in 1904, the Banana Split has become an iconic part of American dessert culture. Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old soda jerk at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hitThe Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as Dr. Dave s among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert.Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry.Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90.In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split, Ice-Cream Joe Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler s invention with the From Pitt Came the Split Event.The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record.Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania David Strickler Inside Strickler s Drug Store Outside Strickler s Drug StorePhotos courtesy of the Latrobe Historical Society Honorary ChairIce Cream Joe GrubleThe legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the From Pitt Came the Split event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013.From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration s honorary chair.

The 27th annual Art All Night is happening April 27 28, 2024 at the Crucible Building in the Strip District. Art All Night Crucible BuildingWhat is Art All Night When I first heard about Art All Night, I was wary. A completely free art show without censorship seemed way too ambitious to live up to the hype. After attending the event for the first time in 2010, it has since become one of my must-do events in Pittsburgh every year One of the few fully uncensored art shows, Art All Night showcases an expansive variety of art. From traditional pieces and Pittsburgh photography to art created in front of your eyes at the event and interactive pieces, Art All Night pays homage to the past, present and future of artistic expression. Not limited to visual art, the show also features top-notch performing arts throughout the event. Previous events featured the works across mediums of more than 500 participants Not only is the art impressive, the venue also adds to the artistic, grassroots atmosphere. Art All Night has taken place in unique industrial and artistic backdrops at trendy neighborhoods around the city, and currently takes place at the Crucible Building in the Strip District. Even the weekend's production is unique. The event is fully produced by an all-volunteer committee and continues to grow each year. The Saturday morning of the event, an army of volunteers spends the hours before the event's start time arranging the art and getting the unique venue ready.

What to Expect at Art All Night With the event fully operational for 22 hours, visitors may wonder when to arrive.

For families, the best time to attend is either Saturday between 4 8 p.m. or Sunday between 10 a.m.-2 p.m., as there are a variety of children's activities. While the show is uncensored, Art All Night does a great job of grouping sensitive subjects and nudity in one area, making it easy for parents to steer clear if they want to. For a serene look at the art, visitors should go early Sunday morning, and before the brunch crowd gets active, when the event is at its quietest.

From my most hipster days to now being a dad and bringing my son, I've always felt at home at Art All Night. There's no pretension at this art show. Everyone is dressed however they want to express themselves, kids are running around and everyone is there to have fun. The art itself is displayed on long walls of strand wood in a giant, spacious warehouse setting. Incredible photographs will share walls with kids' paintings and pop art, and it takes a minimum of an hour or so just to see this part. Throughout the Crucible Building, stages will feature live music Saturday afternoon through early Sunday morning and different sections are set up specifically for live art demos, showing films and interactive adult and kids activities. It's easy to spend four or five hours here to really do and see everything.

We became festival-official in 1985, and shortly thereafter boasted of our East Coast premiere of My Own Private Idaho. In 2012, we changed our name from Pittsburgh Lesbian and Gay Film Society to Reel Q in an effort to be more inclusive of the full LGBTQIA community. Originally conceived as a local space to showcase independent queer cinema that wasn t readily available to mainstream audiences, Reel Q has remained committed to that mission, but also upped the ante with the diversity of our programming, partners, and, of course, parties in the pre and post pandemic times. This October will mark our 38th annual Reel Q film festival, our landmark series of screenings, which is traditionally a 10 day celebration. As the sixth oldest running LGBTQ film festival in the world, we are proud of the longevity of the festival and the friendly audience we ve accrued over the years. The festival is a whirl-windy blast, featuring meet-and-greets with cast members and directors, panel discussions, queer craft markets and, did we mention the parties This year s celebration is scheduled for Oct. 6-15, 2023.

Originally conceived as a local space to showcase independent queer cinema that wasn t readily available to mainstream audiences, Reel Q has remained committed to that mission, but also upped the ante with the diversity of our programming, partners, and, of course, parties in the pre and post pandemic times. This October will mark our 38th annual Reel Q film festival, our landmark series of screenings, which is traditionally a 10 day celebration. As the sixth oldest running LGBTQ film festival in the world, we are proud of the longevity of the festival and the friendly audience we ve accrued over the years. The festival is a whirl-windy blast, featuring meet-and-greets with cast members and directors, panel discussions, queer craft markets and, did we mention the parties This year s celebration is scheduled for Oct. 6-15, 2023.

The orchestra is resident at Heinz Hall, located in Pittsburgh's Cultural District. Since 2008, the orchestra's music director is Manfred Honeck. The orchestra's current president and CEO is Melia Tourangeau. History 1895 1910: Founding and early history The orchestra was founded by the Pittsburgh Arts Society with conductor Frederic Archer in 1895, who brought with him a number of musicians from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and led the PSO in its first concert the following year. In 1898, Victor Herbert was chosen to lead the orchestra.1 The orchestra traveled at a more frequent rate under Herbert's tenure, performing in Boston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Canada.2 Its personnel included such musicians as Luigi von Kunits later the first conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra as concertmaster, first violinist Frederick William Stahlberg3, second violinist John Stepan Zamecnik, assistant principal cello Gaston Borch, Paul Henneberg as first flute, and Leon Medaer as first clarinet.4 Herbert composed two orchestral works that the Pittsburgh Orchestra premiered: his Suite romantique op. 31 which he also dedicated to the orchestra5 and the tone poem Hero and Leander op. 33.6 Under Herbert's direction, the Pittsburgh Orchestra played as part of the Pan-American Exposition at the 1901 World's Fair in Buffalo, New York, for which Herbert had also composed an original work for the exhibition titled Panamericana: Morceau Characteristique for the Orchestra to perform.7 His tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ended in 1904 because of increasingly strident disagreements with the orchestra's manager, George H. Wilson, who disliked Herbert's populist manner and personally despised him.8 When Herbert left the orchestra in 1904, the Symphony Society chose as his successor Austrian conductor Emil Paur. Paur took an intellectual approach to his work and avoided theatrics. Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, as well as guest conductor throughout Europe,9 and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the same exacting standards. Paur's programs emphasized the classical repertoire and increased the presence of works by Johannes Brahms, whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the orchestra's musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians.10 Orchestra manager George H. Wilson resigned on December 24, 1906, shortly after the beginning of Paur's third season, saying that his tenure, pride, and pleasure with the orchestra: Paur remained at the head of the orchestra until it disbanded in 1910. 1910 1938: The New Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra In the interim, concert promoter May Beegle founded the Pittsburgh Orchestra Association to bring other musical performers to the city.1213 Antonio Modarelli, an American conductor and composer, became conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphonic Orchestra in 1930.14 A German newspaper described his conducting as forceful, authentic, modern music,15 and he was invited to conduct in Moscow. He had taught at Duquesne University and been a band leader in the Navy prior to his work in Europe and with the Symphony.161718 This program of frequent guest conductors was made in an effort to restore the symphony to its golden years, but in effect demoted Modarelli, who was finally asked by the Board to resign in 1936.19 Otto Klemperer was responsible for bringing in much new talent while working with the Musicians' Union to hire both local and imported performers.20 Since then, the orchestra has experienced ongoing growth and development, including building a substantial endowment fund.citation needed 1938 1948: The Reiner years Fritz Reiner was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1938 to 1948. Reiner studied with Hungarian composer B la Bart k and programmed many of Bart k's works in Pittsburgh Symphony performances.2122 Women joined the orchestra for the first time during World War II. Eighteen women joined in 1942, and 24 more women joined in 1944. The PSO had more female performers than any other major American symphony during the war.21 Victor De Sabata came to Pittsburgh in 1948, in part because of the urgings of his colleague Vladimir Bakaleinikoff, whom he had conducted in Cincinnati in 1927. Ticket sales increased with de Sabata at the helm. He was so popular with local audiences that around 1,200 people attended a concert he conducted at the Syria Mosque during one of Pittsburgh's worst snowstorms.23 He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1949, 1950, and 1951.24 The orchestra established a Guest Conductor Chair in his name in 2010. 1952 1976: The Steinberg years William Steinberg became the orchestra's music director in 1952. During the early part of the 1950s, the Symphony played a number of industry concerts, conducted by Steinberg and sponsored by area industries, specifically the United Steelworkers of America. The sponsorship offset costs for industry workers, and the Symphony performed in more convenient locations throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.2526 The Symphony continued to bring music to smaller communities in partnership with Manufacturers Heat and Light Company and Columbia Gas during the Steinberg era.27 The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performed for audiences in Warsaw, Madrid, Berlin, Zagreb, Reykjavik, and 15 other locations throughout Europe and the Middle East during the State Department tour.28 Many of the orchestra's earlier recordings were made in the Syrian Mosque with labels such as Capitol Records and Columbia Records.29 The Pittsburgh Symphony performed at the Syria Mosque from 1926 until 1971. The building was torn down in 1992. Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony made several recordings for the Command label starting in 1962. These recordings were made at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh. The technical superiority of the Command recordings was aided by the company's use of 35mm film as the recording medium.30 Steinberg conducted his final Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concerts as music director in 1976, after which he returned for guest-conducting appearances as music director emeritus.3132 1976 1984: The Previn years Andr Previn succeeded Steinberg as music director in 1976. Previn had a collegial working style with symphony musicians and even formed a chamber music trio with Herbert Greenberg, associate concertmaster, and principal cellist Anne Martindale Williams around 1979.33 In 1981, Previn renewed his contract with the symphony orchestra.34 During this time, Victoria Bond served as an affiliate conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1978 to 1980. Bond was the first woman to earn a doctoral degree in orchestral conducting from the Juilliard School and is a prolific composer. While at the Pittsburgh Symphony, she also served as the music director of the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony and the New Amsterdam Symphony in New York City.35 Previn often brought jazz to the concert hall. In February 1977, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Previn made their national debut on PBS with eight specials, Previn and the Pittsburgh. The Alcoa Foundation sponsored the Emmy-nominated36 program, which ran for three years.37 Guests on the program included John Williams, Ella Fitzgerald, and Oscar Peterson. Previn left the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 1984, but is credited with renewing the stature of the orchestra, expanding its position in the community, and giving the city a positive image internationally 38 1984 1996: The Maazel years Lorin Maazel became music consultant to the orchestra in 1984. In 1985, the orchestra elevated Maazel's title to music adviser and principal guest conductor. In 1988, Maazel became music director of the orchestra.39 Maazel announced in 1995 his intention to stand down music director of the orchestra in 1996, to focus on composition.4041 In addition to developing his compositional work, Maazel went on to direct and conduct the New York Philharmonic, along with several orchestras abroad. After his death in July 2014,42 the Pittsburgh Symphony performed memorial pieces for Maazel as well as created a multimedia exhibit featuring Symphony archival materials related to the late director.43 Marvin Hamlisch served as principal pops conductor beginning in 1995 until his death in 2012. 1995 2004: The second century A capital campaign was launched in 1993 to increase the Pittsburgh Symphony's endowment by 70 million. On April 10, 1995, the orchestra announced the appointment of Mariss Jansons to succeed Maazel in 1996 as its eighth music director.44 Latvian born Jansons was well received by critics and audiences in Pittsburgh, who applauded the warmth and humanity that he brought to the ensemble. In addition to directing the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Jansons also served as an influential music director for the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra in Norway until 2002.45 With Jansons, the Pittsburgh Symphony toured all over the world, introducing it to new audiences, and recorded extensively. During this time, the Symphony was innovative in drawing new elements of the Pittsburgh region s population to concerts in Heinz Hall and elsewhere. Jansons conducted his last year as music director of the Symphony during the 2003 2004 season, after which he began acting as director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich.46 The Pittsburgh Symphony under Gilbert Levine was joined by the London Philharmonic Choir, Krak w Philharmonic Choir, Ankara Polyphonic Choir, and members of the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh in a program that included the world premiere of Abraham, a sacred motet by John Harbison, and Mahler Symphony No. 2 Resurrection.4748 The event, which was attended by the Pontiff, Rav Elio Toaff, Imam Abdulawahab Hussein Gomaa, and 7,000 invited guests, was telecast on RAI, on PBS, and throughout the world, and released on DVD by WQED Multimedia, Pittsburgh. Subsequent to this concert, at Levine's impetus, the Pittsburgh Symphony founded a series of concerts entitled Music for the Spirit.49 He led the first two of these performances of the Haydn Creation and Mahler Symphony No. 3 in Pittsburgh in 2006.50 2005 2007: Interregnum With the 2005 2006 season, the PSO introduced a different model for artistic leadership. During this time, a new collective bargaining agreement was in effect, which gave the musicians increased authority over matters of running the orchestra, such as the hiring of musicians and choice of repertoire. Starting in 2005, Sir Andrew Davis served as the PSO artistic advisor, with Yan Pascal Tortelier as principal guest conductor and Marek Janowski holding the endowed guest conductor chair. Sir Andrew Davis, while providing overall programming input regarding the entire season and leading the orchestra in a variety of styles, paid special attention to the music of British and American composers. Davis had been an organ scholar before becoming a conductor. Under his direction, the Symphony performed many symphonic, operatic, and choral works ranging from baroque to contemporary.51 Davis, a Knight Bachelor of Great Britain and music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, had previously led the Pittsburgh Symphony several times as a guest conductor between 1977 and 1990.52 Davis was originally scheduled to step down after the 2007 2008 season, but in October 2007, Davis and the Pittsburgh Symphony mutually agreed to terminate his contract early and for him not to conduct his scheduled concerts in the 2007 2008 season because of increased demands on Davis' schedule.53 The contracts of Tortelier and Janowski also expired in 2008.54 Janowski now holds the Otto Klemperer Guest Conductor Chair with the PSO. 2008 present: Manfred Honeck In May 2006, Manfred Honeck first guest-conducted the PSO. He returned for another guest appearance in November 2006. In January 2007, the PSO announced the appointment of Manfred Honeck as its ninth music director, effective with the 2008 2009 season, in a reversion of conductor leadership format to the traditional music director hierarchy.5556 His initial contract was for three years. In September 2009, the PSO announced the extension of Honeck's contract to the 2015 2016 season.57 In February 2012, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2019 2020 season.58 In June 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of American conductor Leonard Slatkin as the orchestra's principal guest conductor for the 2008 2009 season.5960 In November 2006, the PSO announced a pledge of 29.5 million from the Richard P. Simmons family as the start of a capital challenge for the orchestra to address long-standing financial concerns.61 In December 2006, the PSO announced the launch of an 80 million capital fund-raising drive after the initial 29.5 million boost from the Simmons family.62 In March 2009, the PSO announced the discontinuation of its chamber orchestra series after the 2008 2009 season, along with staff reductions of 9 positions.63 In September 2009, the Pittsburgh Symphony and Honeck agreed to extend his contract through the 2015 2016 season. In February 2012, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2019 2020 season.64 In September 2018, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2021 2022 season.65 In September 2021, the PSO announced the newest extension of Honeck's contract as music director through the 2027 2028 season.66 Music directors Other conductors in leadership positions Broadcasts Previn and the Pittsburgh Launched in 1977, Previn and the Pittsburgh was a series of specials produced by WQED-TV. The Alcoa Foundation sponsored the programs, which ran for three years and became the highest rated classical music series on PBS. The program showcased the diversity of Music Director Andre Previn's musical interests, talents and friends. The first program explored Mozart, with Previn and the Pittsburgh Symphony's Patricia Prattis Jennings playing four-handed piano sonatas. Others featured guest artists John Williams, conducting his music from Star Wars and E.T., Ella Fitzgerald, Yo-Yo Ma, Pittsburgh Symphony principal cello Nathaniel Rosen the first American cellist to win the gold medal at the Tchaikovsky International Competition, composer Stephen Sondheim and violinist Itzhak Perlman. Composer Miklos Rosza appeared as a guest to hear the Pittsburgh Symphony play his Oscar-winning score for the movie Ben-Hur. Previn displayed his considerable talent as a jazz pianist in a duet with his friend Oscar Peterson, the man Duke Ellington dubbed the maharajah of the keyboard. When cameras came into Heinz Hall to film the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra rehearsing in their shirtsleeves, audiences saw a relaxed maestro in bellbottoms who obviously liked and respected the musicians. The first show aired on February 27, 1977, and within two days the Pittsburgh Symphony sold more than 2,500 additional seats.67 Pittsburgh Symphony Radio Launched in 1982, the Pittsburgh Symphony Radio program is hosted by Jim Cunningham of WQED-FM. It is a complete two-hour concert with Music Director Manfred Honeck and guest artists heard on over 100 PRI and NPR stations across the country. The Pittsburgh Symphony was first broadcast in 1936 when NBC Blue Network began a series of 26 half-hour radio broadcasts over the NBC Blue Network of more than 90 stations. The broadcasts were sponsored by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company.6869 Heinz Hall history A 10-million reconstruction of the theater took place between 1967 and 1971. Although much of the structure and d cor remained the same, a new five-story wing was added to the back of the building. This wing expanded the stage and rehearsal space along with the music library and dressing rooms.7071 Several concerts took place before the remodel and reopening of the Hall in 1971, including a performance of works by Berlioz, Beethoven and Brahms by the Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern and Eugene Istomin Trio for the 1969 pension fund concert. Questionnaires filled out by symphony followers were collected after the concert and reflected an overwhelming support of the new venue.72 Heinz Hall was dedicated in September 1971. The inaugural concerts took place on September 10 and 11 with William Steinberg conducting Beethoven's Consecration of the House overture and Mahler's Symphony No. 2 Resurrection with a combined chorus of Pennsylvania State University choirs. The New York Times published an outstanding review of the performances, citing the improvement of the acoustics over previous Symphony venues saying, Pittsburghers at last have the opportunity to hear the orchestra as it ought to sound.73 The Garden Plaza and a four-story addition to the Hall were completed in 1982 by the firm of MacLachlan, Cornelius Filoni.

Founded in 1984, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is a non-profit arts organization whose mission is the cultural and economic revitalization of a 14-block arts and entertainmentresidential neighborhood called the Cultural District. The District is one of the country s largest land masses curated by a single nonprofit arts organization. A major catalytic force in the city, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is a unique model of how public-private partnerships can reinvent a city with authenticity, innovation and creativity. Using the arts as an economic catalyst, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust has holistically created a world-renowned Cultural District that is revitalizing the city, improving the regional economy and enhancing Pittsburgh s quality of life. Thanks to the support of foundations, corporations, government agencies and thousands of private citizens, the Trust stands as a national model of urban redevelopment through the arts. Since 1984, the Trust has restored historic theaters, constructed new performance venues, commissioned public art projects and developed unique urban parks and riverfront recreation spaces. As one of the largest Downtown Pittsburgh property owners, the Trust manages one million square feet of property, including: The Trust encourages and presents diverse performing and visual arts programs. Its main programming divisions include: About the Cultural District During the G-20 Pittsburgh Summit, the international focus was on the David L. Lawrence Convention Center located in Pittsburgh s Cultural District, which is a project of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. This vibrant district sets the perfect stage for the international summit on economic recovery as a unique international model of urban revitalization through the arts and a paradigm for successful public-private partnerships. Once a blighted adults-only neighborhood known for sex shops, prostitutes and XXX-movie theaters, the Cultural District today attracts over 2,000,000 visitors annually generating an estimated economic impact of 303 million. Pittsburgh s third renaissance can be traced to H.J. Jack Heinz II, a founder of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Mr. Heinz envisioned a colossal transformation that would turn a city once called hell with its lid off into a thriving hub of world-class art and entertainment, buzzing with 247 activity. His vision was two-pronged: the arts could serve as a catalyst for economic, commercial and residential development of Downtown Pittsburgh, while enriching the quality of life for residents and visitors alike. When other U.S. cities abandoned their respective downtowns for strip malls and big-box stores, Pittsburgh s Cultural District preserved its historical significance by leveraging the power of the arts to create an authentic destination that draws over two million visitors, arts lovers, students, residents and employers to over 1,500 events each year. The District includes Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Pittsburgh CLO, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh Public Theater, Pittsburgh Symphony and August Wilson Center for African American Culture, among hundreds of other arts groups and artists. The Cultural District is also home to the city s High School for Creative and Performing Arts. Unlike other cities that house cultural activity within a single performing arts center, Pittsburgh s Cultural District comprises 14 blocks that were holistically developed with the creation of multiple theaters, art galleries, public art projects, urban parks and riverfront recreation spaces.
