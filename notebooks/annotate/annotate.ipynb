From skulls to car crashes, both artists deploy their signature bright colors and pop culture references while also presenting the lurid spectacle of death. The dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time. KAWS will also respond to Warholâ€™s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures, and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some of Americaâ€™s most loved cereal boxes including Reeseâ€™s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will', 'be juxtaposed with Warholâ€™s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children. In response to The Warholâ€™s new initiative The Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible from its entrance space.KAWS + Warhol is presented by UNIQLO Major support provided by Nemacolin, Jim Spencer & Michael Lin, and Kathe & Jim Patrinos.
